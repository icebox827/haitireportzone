		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do most doctors fully understand human physiology? At least to the degree they need to for public health and chronic disease? Most doctors think they know plenty about human physiology, but many don’t. In fact, many doctors are missing some of the most fundamental principles of how human physiology misfires when consuming the modern western diet, particularly too much meat and dairy. What most doctors are taught in medical school is a set of rules created more around pharmacological-based medicine and less about true evidenced-based medicine.

Is there a flaw or a conspiracy? Nobody can claim any one reason to the problem. Nevertheless, many of the rules governing how modern health care is taught and practiced can be linked back some 100 years earlier to the Flexner Report. The Flexner Report came out in the early 1900s and it still accounts for much of how medicine is controlled in the modern era. The report essentially enabled a few powerful global elites to insert themselves and their personal bias and beliefs into how the science and education of modern medicine is conducted and controlled in the United States, and fundamentally throughout the world. It may have done more harm than good, as it has led to a global epidemic of chronically sick human beings. This new generation of humans may be the first in history with a lifespan less than that of their parents.

<img class="wp-image-124 size-medium alignright" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/HGH-Reverse-heart-disease-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />

This article is not about the Flexner Report or modern suppression of the scientific evidence related to the reversal of heart disease with diet and supplementation, which can accelerate the process. That can be explored another day. This blog is about using the evidence-based knowledge and research we currently have, and then applying it correctly to achieve the successful reversal of heart disease and possibly many other leading chronic diseases.
<h1>Reverse Heart Disease: Plant Based Diet, Niacin and HGH Therapy</h1>
Heart Disease Key Facts:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death globally each and every year.
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>It’s estimated that 17.5 million people died from cardiovascular disease in 2012. 7.4 million of these deaths were due to heart disease and 6.7 million caused by stroke.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Most (we would argue all) of these deaths are preventable with diet and lifestyle changes.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The good news is cardiovascular disease can be avoided. The better news is now it can be reversed, even in patients who are in the later stages of coronary artery disease.

One of the first clues we need to look at in our understanding of true human physiology is to explore why dogs don’t die of heart attacks. Is it because they eat only dog food? If you want to test this on your cardiologist, ask him the question below.
<blockquote><strong>The next time you’re sitting across from your cardiologist, ask him: “Dr., why don’t dogs die of heart attacks?” See how they respond!</strong></blockquote>
The answer is an easy one. It shows us a lot about how simple heart disease is to avoid, reverse, and RESOLVE!
<blockquote><strong>Atherosclerosis is easily produced experimentally in herbivores (rabbits) by giving them diets containing large quantities of cholesterol (egg yolks) or saturated fats (animal fats), while impossible to induce in tigers, lions and dogs!</strong></blockquote>
Armed with this information, most third graders can begin to solve the riddle of modern heart disease. Our epidemic of cardiovascular disease is mainly due to the level of animal based products we consume. Therefore, humans must be more physiologically associated to herbivores, so we should eat more similarly to herbivores than to carnivores if we want to protect ourselves from disease. This is profound to understanding how to manage, prevent and reverse cardiovascular disease properly. If we just eat fruits and vegetables, ideally a well planned healthy whole-food plant based diet, these diseases will decline and possibly disappear completely. That’s exactly what doctors Dean Ornish, M.D. and Caldwell Esselstyn, M.D. did in their published research on reversing heart disease.
<h3>Plant-Based Diet: A plant-based diet combined with Niacin and HGH replacement therapy can help reverse heart disease.</h3>
Read Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, MD research

Here are the rules to Dr. Esselstyn’s program in their simplest form taken from his book:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>You may not eat anything with a mother or a face (no meat, poultry, or fish).</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You cannot eat dairy products.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You must not consume oil of any kind— not a drop. (Yes, you devotees of the Mediterranean Diet, that includes olive oil)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Generally, you cannot eat nuts or avocados.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Esselstyn states further, you can eat a wonderful variety of delicious, nutrient-dense foods:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>All vegetables except avocado. Leafy green vegetables, root vegetables, veggies that are red, green, purple, orange, and yellow and everything in between.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All legumes— beans, peas, and lentils of all varieties. All whole grains and products, such as bread and pasta, that are made from them— as long as they do not contain added fats.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All fruits.– Esselstyn Jr. M.D., Caldwell B.. Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Basically, if you can navigate these rules, you can work with one of our nutritionists to build a heart healthy diet around these rules. For many, it may seem impossible, but once people learn there are a number of delicious recipes, a transformation in dietary habits can be taught and applied in a matter of a week or two. Dr. Dean Ornish found in his research that it usually required approximately 72 hours of instruction before it really begins to click in the minds of the patient.

To summarize Esselstyn: “Heart disease is nothing more than a paper tiger.” We agree. It is nothing more than working to keep total cholesterol around 150 mg/dL and LDL-c below 60 mg/dL. It’s been reported, that no one ever died of cardiovascular disease in the famous Framingham Heart Study with a total cholesterol of 150 or lower. That was a multi-generational study which began in the late 1940s and continued into the 1990s.

That’s about where the Esselstyn / Ornish style heart reversal programs end. A whole food plant based diet. What we can do in addition is combine other research, and those supplements shown in the research, to help accelerate and improve body composition and lipids (HGH and Niacin primarily), leading to better results sooner. This kind of program can be started at any of our international treatment centers under the supervision of a medical professional and counselors experienced in plant-based nutrition protocols.
<h3><strong>Niacin: Niacin is an important component for reversing heart disease with HGH and Diet
</strong></h3>
First we start with Niacin. Niacin is an inexpensive vitamin supplement. It’s one of the first supplements used to treat low HDL. HDL cholesterol is called the cleaning cholesterol. It’s the good cholesterol that helps remove the bad (LDL) cholesterol. This is a simple explanation, but more or less that’s what is going on inside your arteries. The good HDL helps clear the bad LDL. Treatment works to drive down LDL cholesterol (the oxidized / bad form ) with diet, and elevate the HDL cholesterol (cleaning / good form) with Niacin. Therefore, the anti-atherogenic effects of HDL occur by reverse cholesterol transport of oxidized LDL cholesterol, resulting in restoring part or all of endothelial cell function. (<em>Endothelial cells are the lining in your artery walls</em>).

Niacin has been shown to raise HDL (good cholesterol) by as much as 30-35%. It can also reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) particle size (a good thing) from small dense pattern B to larger non-atherogenic pattern A.

Generally we recommend 1 – 3 grams of Niacin per day (See Ref: Baylor University Medical Proceedings p 126, Vol. 26, No. 2).

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>HGH / IGF-1: HGH is another important component to reversing heart disease with a plant-based diet and niacin.
</strong></h3>
We all know that obesity is strongly correlated to heart disease. Epidemiological studies demonstrate an increase in coronary heart disease mortality in men and women with higher than average body mass indexes. What’s more, obesity is strongly related to cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia.

In the famous Dr. Rudman study on HGH in men over 60 years of age, it was found that decreased levels of growth hormone secretion is responsible in part to a decrease in lean body mass, and an increase in fat tissue mass. HGH replacement therapy helps aging men and women maintain more muscle mass and less fat, resulting in an overall improved body composition.

It’s also been shown that diabetic women who use natural bio-identical hormone replacement therapy are more likely to have their blood glucose under control and have lower cholesterol levels.

In recent studies it has been shown that short courses of growth hormone replacement therapy reduced LDL (bad cholesterol). That’s good, as we want bad cholesterol to be below 60 mg/dL ideally.

HGH shows improvements in exercise capacity and cardiac function. Those undergoing HGH replacement therapy show increased oxygen uptake and power output during exercise. Echocardiography has shown that left ventricular muscle mass index, fractional shortening, and fiber shortening velocity all improve after 6 months of low-dose HGH therapy.

Cardiovascular symptoms of growth hormone deficiency include:
<ul>
 	<li>Hardened vessels (sclerosis of vessel wall).</li>
 	<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>
 	<li>Reduced NO-production</li>
 	<li>Increased fibrinogen and PAI-1</li>
 	<li>Hypertension</li>
</ul>
Ref: A4M Michael Klentze, MD, PhD p 418

These factors along with overall body composition attest to the benefits of supporting a heart healthy diet with niacin and HGH replacement therapies. For those with heart disease or for those who wish to live longer without heart disease, we can help. Heart disease can be avoided and reversed with a whole food plant based diet. Outcomes can be improved and accelerated with additional HGH and Niacin supplementation.]]></content:encoded>

<h4><strong>The main thing that you have to remember on this journey</strong><strong> is nice to everyone and always smile.</strong></h4>
It’s kind of confusing because I’m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I’m not the biggest girl on the market but I’m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn’t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.It’s kind of confusing because I’m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says.

Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.

<blockquote>BE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD</blockquote>
They released me in this campaign with everyone else there no distinction. It’s not a separate section for plus size girls she says.

There was a time in the industry not too long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was using plus size models as a headline-grabbing gimmick see the groundbreaking <a href="#">Italian Vogue</a> cover featuring Tara Lynn, Candice Huffine, and Robyn Lawley in June 2016.long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was.

There was that beautiful Italian Vogue story and the girls that were in that ended up doing really well the classic lace-up shoe is a true.

I feel like for a minute, it was starting to feel like this plus size I’m not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls really was a trend.

That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.
<h5><strong>WordPress a difficult game because everyone wants to be cool in fashion.</strong></h5>
Now, Dalbesio is a bit more hopeful about size in the modeling industry ma quande lingues coalesce. In the middle Occidental in fact she says not skinny enough.That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.

To find my place. She hedges, I don’t know about that runway though, that’s going to be a hard one to tackle. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant right to find fault pleasure?

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee,take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time in their history, Team Germany has beaten an American national squad as they defeated the USA, represented by the United States Federation of American Football, 14-13 at the World Games in Wroclaw, Poland, in a game which should not have been that close.

The USFAF team, which almost did not make it to the World Games, was put together, literally within a couple of days.

With barely one practice under their belts and a roster which was below the minimum 45, a rag tag United States team took the field to face a well-prepared German team  in the middle of the regular season in Germany.

And it showed as Team Germany controlled much of the play. Nevertheless, Team USA battled.

After a quiet first quarter, in which Germany missed a chance to take the lead on a missed field goal, Team Germany opened the scoring. Quarterback Alexander Haupert connected with 6’9″ wide receiver Aurieus Adegbesan on a 43 yard touchdown pass and Thomas Rauch kicked the extra point to give the Germans a 7-0 lead.

The United States responded on the next series with quarterback Dustin Hawke Willingham, who was struggling to find any kind of rhythm, finally finding Terry Gaitor for a 47 yard touchdown. John Moorhead kicked the extra point and the score was tied at halftime.

The Americans entered the third quarter with some momentum and began to take charge as Hawke Willingham led his team on a long drive, capping it with a 26 yard touchdown to Tyrell Banks giving Team USA a 13-7 lead. The missed extra point proved to be crucial.

With Haupert replaced at quarterback by Sonny Weishaupt, Germany began to take control in the fourth quarter. Weishaupt finally led his team on an extended drive, finishing it off with a 28 yard touchdown pass to Kwame Ofori. Thomas Rauch kicked the extra point to take a 14-13 lead.

Team Germany then held on for the win.

Turnovers proved to be costly for Team USA as the American quarterback threw four interceptions.

This was not the first time a USFAF team has lost to European competition. In 2012, Team Denmark defeated them 49-20.

In the second semifinal, Team France defeated Poland 28-2. Germany will face France in the gold medal final on Monday, July 24 while Team USA will play Poland in the bronze medal game.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 3-4 Seahawks are headed to Arlington and seeking revenge against the 2-4 Cowboys who shocked the world by beating the reigning Super Bowl champs at home in 2014. Something no other opponent was able to do..

The Seahawks, much like the Cowboys, are off to a slow start in 2015. Both teams are desperately seeking some new found hope in a last ditch effort to return to the playoffs. In this post the YDCFF staff share our thoughts and predictions for the rematch.

<strong>Kevin Sivells:</strong> Well, it is revenge time for the Seattle Seahawks. They are coming into Dallas with a chip on their shoulders. I am pretty sure they have not forgotten how these Cowboys rode into Seattle last season and out muscled them in their home stadium.
I am pretty sure they want to return the favor. The way the Dallas Cowboys offense is playing right now they may just get the last laugh. On the other side, the way the Boys defense is stepping up, anything is possible in this game.

Only unit that is operating close to full strength. If the offense can sustain some drives to keep them fresh, I believe they can contain Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson. This means Cassel has to take care of the ball and Garrett has to stick to the running game. Especially since Darren McFadden is showing why you brought him to Dallas in the first place. The Seahawks are just as hungry for a win. The NFC West is a division you do not want to fall to far behind in. The defense is starting to come back to life and the offense is starting to find Jimmy Graham.

Bottom line, this game is a battle of wills. WILL the Cowboys offense help the defense by limiting turnovers? Will the Cowboys defense have enough gas in the tank towards the end of the second half if the offense doesn’t help? Will this be the game the Seattle Seahawks return to their old form? My prediction for this game is simple. If Matt Cassel can show some resemblance to Danny White (We know Aikman, Romo, Staubach he will NEVER be), the Cowboys might have a chance. Right now I see this game going to the Seahawks 28-17. Sorry guys. I don’t see Matt Cassel getting around the Seattle defense.

<strong>Al Beam:</strong> The Seahawks are currently victims of not only the salary cap, but some poor decisions by the front office. Giving a big contract to a QB who has never shown the ability to stand in the pocket and win games with his arm, or show any consistency as a deep threat, has led to them losing some key players up front. Football is won in the trenches and the Seahawks sacrificed three offensive linemen. Two of them went to the Jets, and the third to the Saints (All Pro Center Max Unger) in a trade for Jimmy Graham. For them to think Russell Wilson would have the same chemistry with Graham that Drew Brees did, was foolish at best.

&nbsp;

<img class="alignnone wp-image-96 size-full" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Earl-Watford.png" alt="" width="900" height="500" />

Not prioritizing the protection of their highest paid player makes no sense to me and the results were predictable. Wilson is the most sacked QB in the NFL with 31, despite his mobility. His passing production has never merited the contract he got. Currently he has amassed 1,668 yards (238.2 YPG, 28th in the NFL) 8 Tds, 5 INTs and 3 fumbles. He continues to ride on the back of Marshawn Lynch and his defense that is 5th in points allowed (18.3), 3rd in yards per game (294.1), 3rd against the pass (200 YPG), and 6th against the run (94.1 YPG). Much like the Cowboys, their defense needs some help from the offense.

This game is going to come down to two things. Which team can have the most success running the ball, and which QB can do a better job of sustaining drives and putting up points without turning the ball over. The Giants secondary isn’t even in the same zip code as the Seattle Seahawks and Matt Cassel threw 3 interceptions. Russell Wilson has a passer rating of 97.0 to Matt Cassel’s 62.3; despite having arguably the worst OL in the NFL. With Tony Romo or Kellen Moore at the helm, I would give the nod to the Cowboys, but I can’t trust Matt Cassel to protect the football against the 3rd ranked secondary in the NFL.

The Seahawks will pound Lynch on the ground to keep the pass rush at bay and the coaches will trust their secondary in man coverage so they can focus on taking away the run and getting pressure on Cassel. Forcing Matt to win with his arm will lead to turnovers. I am not going to predict a score, but I anticipate a win by the Seahawks. . I just can’t trust the QB.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Four test playing nations. A former World Number One lost its way to experience one of the lowest points in the annals of their sporting history. In recent times, a supremely insurmountable side at home became more prone to defeats. A team famously regarded as the most volatile side to have taken the field endured isolation and wilderness in the Arabian deserts. A team deemed misfit started making significant strides that the world took note of. These are tumultuous yet exciting times for the test playing nations from the subcontinent.

One day, the leaves wither as they turn old. India and Sri Lanka are primarily experiencing this phase. There are more greens on their tree today. Pakistan is almost in a situation where the leaves are about to fall. The cricketing expiry for Misbah and Younus is much closer than what it was yesterday. Take the story of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, for example. The chances of comeback become slim for the veteran sportsmen moment the form slips away. As long as the fire in the lamp withstands the external pressure of the winds, these legendary players can continue writing more pages in their autobiographies.

&nbsp;

India, now in the Sri Lankan shores, are all set to be challenged in conditions they are more familiar of. Ever since the dramatic 8-0 whitewashes in 2011-12, India showed mild signs of recovery. They have had to reshuffle the batting line up ever since the glorious trinity signed off along with the famous Delhi openers who seem to have lost their mojo. Fortunately, they have managed to construct another batting order which a lot of top ranked test countries can feel jealous about. But that’s about the best part of the segment that the team can feel proud of. As a unit, the losses at South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia meant that the slide wasn’t arrested. With the one-off Bangladesh test abandoned due to rain, this Lankan tour is the beginning of a two year journey around the rivers and mountains of the sub-continent.

With a new leader and with the Board all set to soon announce the new coach, who would be the man to plot the route map for the future, India’s test resurgence is in tricky waters. The followers of the sport in the mad nation have had a long break since the IPL. Since IPL they have had to endure an ignominious one-day tour of Bangladesh. It has been the longest break for the team for a long time. Kohli has promised that he will play five bowlers thus thrusting more responsibility both on the top and the lower order batsmen. So far, Kohli’s approach as a leader has been all about making the moves to create a positive result. The aggressive attitude now goes a step further to embolden and empower the players with more trust and responsibility. It is time for his players to contribute with a very conscious mindset craving for consistency. With more matches scheduled in the sub-continent, the onus would be on the spinners to take lead with the attack.

On the other side of the border, Pakistan’s resurgence in test cricket has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is no easy task to defend at the adopted home as well as to beat the Lankans in their territory. Significantly, the batsmen contributed crucial runs for their bowlers to pick twenty wickets. After a relentless search for steady batsmen who build their game on temperament, Pakistan seem to have solved the puzzle. Ahmed Shehzad’s ability to convert starts into hundreds has provided a reasonable stability at the top of the order. Shan Masood, is still very young. But he showed enough gumption to convince about his ability and temperament. Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali have been the biggest finds for Pakistan cricket in recent times. They have been the pillars around whom the game revolves. The best part about the two is that, they emerge from a different school of cricket where calmness and patience are considered as stepping stones for success. Shafiq and Ali have both tasted success and have good knowledge of what it takes to score hundreds in test matches. Between Shafiq and Ali, come the most experienced Pakistani pair of Younus Khan and Misbah Ul Haq. While they both don’t seem to come close to an end with their careers, Pakistan’s fresh approach in ODIs gives a good look into their batting resources when the legends call it a day. That Pakistan completed a rout in Sri Lanka, defeating the hosts in all formats of the game, shows that the team is experiencing a positive growth. After the final T20, there were great scenes of camaraderie and team bonding. Importantly, Pakistan have showed that they enough stomach for challenge and hunger for victory.

The inclusion of Sarfaraz Ahmed in the middle order is the single most powerful addition for their line-up. Teams are prone to produce inconsistent results if they carry a lot of flashy batsmen. Such batsmen will change the complexion of the game within a session or two. Since their approach can’t be tempered, it would be difficult to expect them play a fighting innings. Sarfaraz, amazingly, can play both roles. He has lent fire to the batting order that finally found solidity and method to their game.

While Pakistan need not worry about the fast bowler produce, Saeed Ajmal’s exit from the scene could have spelt dooms for any team. Yasir Shah’s emergence as an attacking leg spinner smoothened the transition. Yasir Shah provides Misbah with both control and strike force. When the batsmen succeed, Shah becomes a bigger prospect for Pakistan’s success. The way he bowled in Sri Lanka on not so friendly surfaces was a display of his stern character and his ability to play according to the conditions.

Pakistan’s biggest challenge, though, is yet to arrive. They have slowly begun to become a strong opponent in home conditions. But just like how the challenge was for India, or for that matter any other subcontinent team, Pakistan’s ability to survive and succeed will be tested on a bigger scale when they play in Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand.

The latest victim of the Bangladesh assault were the South Africans. Not so long ago, Bangladesh gave both India and Pakistan a rude lesson that told the world that they have finally arrived. While Bangladesh’s resurgence has mostly been in the ODIs, they made some impression when they bowled out South Africa for under 250 and took an important lead in the first test at Dhaka. The promise that Bangladesh have shown in the past six months only makes us believe that the team has matured heads who are ready to act responsibly for team’s success now. At the helm of affairs is Hathurusinghe, who is carving a legacy of his own with this resurgence. The coach has gone the long yards to make his team believe that they definitely can. The likes of Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mashrafe Mortaza have absorbed enough quality of international cricket, that they can be the torch bearers for Bangladesh cricket now. These players have shown immense maturity in taking ownership on the field and guiding the younger ones in the best way possible.

Considering the following that Bangladesh have in their backyard, it was going to be impossible for them to never improve. All this while, the stars who are torch bearers today were seeking inspiration to grow bigger. Their heroes never made it big. They got back home defeated again and again.

With Australia touring Bangladesh next, there wouldn’t be a better measure of their progress than testing it against Australia’s Gold Standard.

Sri Lanka have a problem aplenty. It is a mixed scenario that each of India and Pakistan have experienced for a long time. Under Angelo Mathews, this Lankan team is taking baby steps with their resurgence. The best aspect of this resurgence has been the performance of their fast bowlers. The tank is full with quality that Mathews can afford to prepare fast and seaming tracks for their bowlers to achieve desired results. Dhammika Prasad has come of age. Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal and Dushmantha Chameera have had their moments. Twenty three year old Chameera, especially, has come for a lot of praise. Along with the captain himself, Sri Lanka’s pace attack are in good shape for the present and for the immediate future.

But their real concerns come with their batsmen. Jayawardane is gone. Dilshan is gone. So will Sangakkara by the end of this month. While the batting has shown odd sparks with Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews continues to be the lynch pin in this batting order. The replacements and the next-in-line are the players who have been there with the team earlier. Jehan Mubarak’s and Upul Tharanga’s selections gives away the fact that the older men who were discarded before, continue to be the best of the lot to play test cricket. Sangakkara’s fear in the loss of quality in the first class cricket, is well placed. If the structure can’t produce new talents then there is something wrong that needs to be fixed at the earliest.

The Lankans trust Chandimal and Thirimanne a lot. While they have been impressive in shorter formats, both players need to raise their hands up now to shoulder responsibility. The series against India, is hence going to be very crucial for these two players. If both of them fail to make any mark, the middle order will be in tatters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The death toll from monsoon floods in India, Bangladesh and Nepal has climbed above 1,200, as rescue workers scramble to provide aid to millions of people stranded by the worst such disaster in years.

All three countries suffer frequent flooding during the June-September monsoon season, but international aid agencies say things are worse this year with thousands of villages cut off and people deprived of food and clean water for days.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conducted an aerial survey of flood-hit Bihar state on Saturday and has pledged a relief fund of $78m.

A flash flood emergency has been declared in the Houston area of Texas by the National Weather Service after water reached the second floors of houses south of the city. The heavy rains were brought about by hurricane Harvey, now downgraded to a tropical storm.

Government officials in India's eastern state of Bihar told Reuters news agency on Friday that at least 379 people had been killed over the past few days, with thousands sheltered in relief camps away from their inundated homes.

Some rivers in the Houston area were at around eight to ten feet (2.4-3 meters) over their banks, WBTV reported.

Over a thousand people have been rescued from the affected area since early Saturday.

<em>“I know for a fact this is the worst flood Houston has ever experienced,”</em> Patrick Blood, National Weather Service meteorologist, told the Houston Chronicle.

Blood warned that the<em> </em>“<em>catastrophic flooding in the Houston metropolitan area is expected to worsen.”</em>

The National Weather Service has warned that rainfall from Hurricane Harvey could reach 50 inches (1.27 meters) in some places, which would be the highest-ever level registered in Texas.

George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston has announced the cancellation of commercial flights due to the flooding]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

[caption id="attachment_1066" align="alignright" width="275"]<img class="wp-image-1066 size-full" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-4.png" alt="single-images-7" width="275" height="376" /> Katy playing audio lessons[/caption]

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do most doctors fully understand human physiology? At least to the degree they need to for public health and chronic disease? Most doctors think they know plenty about human physiology, but many don’t. In fact, many doctors are missing some of the most fundamental principles of how human physiology misfires when consuming the modern western diet, particularly too much meat and dairy. What most doctors are taught in medical school is a set of rules created more around pharmacological-based medicine and less about true evidenced-based medicine.

Is there a flaw or a conspiracy? Nobody can claim any one reason to the problem. Nevertheless, many of the rules governing how modern health care is taught and practiced can be linked back some 100 years earlier to the Flexner Report. The Flexner Report came out in the early 1900s and it still accounts for much of how medicine is controlled in the modern era. The report essentially enabled a few powerful global elites to insert themselves and their personal bias and beliefs into how the science and education of modern medicine is conducted and controlled in the United States, and fundamentally throughout the world. It may have done more harm than good, as it has led to a global epidemic of chronically sick human beings. This new generation of humans may be the first in history with a lifespan less than that of their parents.

This article is not about the Flexner Report or modern suppression of the scientific evidence related to the reversal of heart disease with diet and supplementation, which can accelerate the process. That can be explored another day. This blog is about using the evidence-based knowledge and research we currently have, and then applying it correctly to achieve the successful reversal of heart disease and possibly many other leading chronic diseases.
<h1>Reverse Heart Disease: Plant Based Diet, Niacin and HGH Therapy</h1>
Heart Disease Key Facts:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death globally each and every year.
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>It’s estimated that 17.5 million people died from cardiovascular disease in 2012. 7.4 million of these deaths were due to heart disease and 6.7 million caused by stroke.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Most (we would argue all) of these deaths are preventable with diet and lifestyle changes.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The good news is cardiovascular disease can be avoided. The better news is now it can be reversed, even in patients who are in the later stages of coronary artery disease.

One of the first clues we need to look at in our understanding of true human physiology is to explore why dogs don’t die of heart attacks. Is it because they eat only dog food? If you want to test this on your cardiologist, ask him the question below.
<blockquote><strong>The next time you’re sitting across from your cardiologist, ask him: “Dr., why don’t dogs die of heart attacks?” See how they respond!</strong></blockquote>
The answer is an easy one. It shows us a lot about how simple heart disease is to avoid, reverse, and RESOLVE!
<blockquote><strong>Atherosclerosis is easily produced experimentally in herbivores (rabbits) by giving them diets containing large quantities of cholesterol (egg yolks) or saturated fats (animal fats), while impossible to induce in tigers, lions and dogs!</strong></blockquote>
Armed with this information, most third graders can begin to solve the riddle of modern heart disease. Our epidemic of cardiovascular disease is mainly due to the level of animal based products we consume. Therefore, humans must be more physiologically associated to herbivores, so we should eat more similarly to herbivores than to carnivores if we want to protect ourselves from disease. This is profound to understanding how to manage, prevent and reverse cardiovascular disease properly. If we just eat fruits and vegetables, ideally a well planned healthy whole-food plant based diet, these diseases will decline and possibly disappear completely. That’s exactly what doctors Dean Ornish, M.D. and Caldwell Esselstyn, M.D. did in their published research on reversing heart disease.
<h3>Plant-Based Diet: A plant-based diet combined with Niacin and HGH replacement therapy can help reverse heart disease.</h3>
Read Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, MD research

Here are the rules to Dr. Esselstyn’s program in their simplest form taken from his book:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>You may not eat anything with a mother or a face (no meat, poultry, or fish).</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You cannot eat dairy products.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You must not consume oil of any kind— not a drop. (Yes, you devotees of the Mediterranean Diet, that includes olive oil)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Generally, you cannot eat nuts or avocados.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Esselstyn states further, you can eat a wonderful variety of delicious, nutrient-dense foods:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>All vegetables except avocado. Leafy green vegetables, root vegetables, veggies that are red, green, purple, orange, and yellow and everything in between.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All legumes— beans, peas, and lentils of all varieties. All whole grains and products, such as bread and pasta, that are made from them— as long as they do not contain added fats.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All fruits.– Esselstyn Jr. M.D., Caldwell B.. Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Basically, if you can navigate these rules, you can work with one of our nutritionists to build a heart healthy diet around these rules. For many, it may seem impossible, but once people learn there are a number of delicious recipes, a transformation in dietary habits can be taught and applied in a matter of a week or two. Dr. Dean Ornish found in his research that it usually required approximately 72 hours of instruction before it really begins to click in the minds of the patient.

To summarize Esselstyn: “Heart disease is nothing more than a paper tiger.” We agree. It is nothing more than working to keep total cholesterol around 150 mg/dL and LDL-c below 60 mg/dL. It’s been reported, that no one ever died of cardiovascular disease in the famous Framingham Heart Study with a total cholesterol of 150 or lower. That was a multi-generational study which began in the late 1940s and continued into the 1990s.

That’s about where the Esselstyn / Ornish style heart reversal programs end. A whole food plant based diet. What we can do in addition is combine other research, and those supplements shown in the research, to help accelerate and improve body composition and lipids (HGH and Niacin primarily), leading to better results sooner. This kind of program can be started at any of our international treatment centers under the supervision of a medical professional and counselors experienced in plant-based nutrition protocols.
<h3><strong>Niacin: Niacin is an important component for reversing heart disease with HGH and Diet
</strong></h3>
First we start with Niacin. Niacin is an inexpensive vitamin supplement. It’s one of the first supplements used to treat low HDL. HDL cholesterol is called the cleaning cholesterol. It’s the good cholesterol that helps remove the bad (LDL) cholesterol. This is a simple explanation, but more or less that’s what is going on inside your arteries. The good HDL helps clear the bad LDL. Treatment works to drive down LDL cholesterol (the oxidized / bad form ) with diet, and elevate the HDL cholesterol (cleaning / good form) with Niacin. Therefore, the anti-atherogenic effects of HDL occur by reverse cholesterol transport of oxidized LDL cholesterol, resulting in restoring part or all of endothelial cell function. (<em>Endothelial cells are the lining in your artery walls</em>).

Niacin has been shown to raise HDL (good cholesterol) by as much as 30-35%. It can also reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) particle size (a good thing) from small dense pattern B to larger non-atherogenic pattern A.

Generally we recommend 1 – 3 grams of Niacin per day (See Ref: Baylor University Medical Proceedings p 126, Vol. 26, No. 2).

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>HGH / IGF-1: HGH is another important component to reversing heart disease with a plant-based diet and niacin.
</strong></h3>
We all know that obesity is strongly correlated to heart disease. Epidemiological studies demonstrate an increase in coronary heart disease mortality in men and women with higher than average body mass indexes. What’s more, obesity is strongly related to cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia.

In the famous Dr. Rudman study on HGH in men over 60 years of age, it was found that decreased levels of growth hormone secretion is responsible in part to a decrease in lean body mass, and an increase in fat tissue mass. HGH replacement therapy helps aging men and women maintain more muscle mass and less fat, resulting in an overall improved body composition.

It’s also been shown that diabetic women who use natural bio-identical hormone replacement therapy are more likely to have their blood glucose under control and have lower cholesterol levels.

In recent studies it has been shown that short courses of growth hormone replacement therapy reduced LDL (bad cholesterol). That’s good, as we want bad cholesterol to be below 60 mg/dL ideally.

HGH shows improvements in exercise capacity and cardiac function. Those undergoing HGH replacement therapy show increased oxygen uptake and power output during exercise. Echocardiography has shown that left ventricular muscle mass index, fractional shortening, and fiber shortening velocity all improve after 6 months of low-dose HGH therapy.

Cardiovascular symptoms of growth hormone deficiency include:
<ul>
 	<li>Hardened vessels (sclerosis of vessel wall).</li>
 	<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>
 	<li>Reduced NO-production</li>
 	<li>Increased fibrinogen and PAI-1</li>
 	<li>Hypertension</li>
</ul>
Ref: A4M Michael Klentze, MD, PhD p 418

These factors along with overall body composition attest to the benefits of supporting a heart healthy diet with niacin and HGH replacement therapies. For those with heart disease or for those who wish to live longer without heart disease, we can help. Heart disease can be avoided and reversed with a whole food plant based diet. Outcomes can be improved and accelerated with additional HGH and Niacin supplementation.]]></content:encoded>

Esselstyn states further, you can eat a wonderful variety of delicious, nutrient-dense foods:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>All vegetables except avocado. Leafy green vegetables, root vegetables, veggies that are red, green, purple, orange, and yellow and everything in between.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All legumes— beans, peas, and lentils of all varieties. All whole grains and products, such as bread and pasta, that are made from them— as long as they do not contain added fats.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All fruits.– Esselstyn Jr. M.D., Caldwell B.. Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Basically, if you can navigate these rules, you can work with one of our nutritionists to build a heart healthy diet around these rules. For many, it may seem impossible, but once people learn there are a number of delicious recipes, a transformation in dietary habits can be taught and applied in a matter of a week or two. Dr. Dean Ornish found in his research that it usually required approximately 72 hours of instruction before it really begins to click in the minds of the patient.

To summarize Esselstyn: “Heart disease is nothing more than a paper tiger.” We agree. It is nothing more than working to keep total cholesterol around 150 mg/dL and LDL-c below 60 mg/dL. It’s been reported, that no one ever died of cardiovascular disease in the famous Framingham Heart Study with a total cholesterol of 150 or lower. That was a multi-generational study which began in the late 1940s and continued into the 1990s.

That’s about where the Esselstyn / Ornish style heart reversal programs end. A whole food plant based diet. What we can do in addition is combine other research, and those supplements shown in the research, to help accelerate and improve body composition and lipids (HGH and Niacin primarily), leading to better results sooner. This kind of program can be started at any of our international treatment centers under the supervision of a medical professional and counselors experienced in plant-based nutrition protocols.
<h3><strong>Niacin: Niacin is an important component for reversing heart disease with HGH and Diet
</strong></h3>
First we start with Niacin. Niacin is an inexpensive vitamin supplement. It’s one of the first supplements used to treat low HDL. HDL cholesterol is called the cleaning cholesterol. It’s the good cholesterol that helps remove the bad (LDL) cholesterol. This is a simple explanation, but more or less that’s what is going on inside your arteries. The good HDL helps clear the bad LDL. Treatment works to drive down LDL cholesterol (the oxidized / bad form ) with diet, and elevate the HDL cholesterol (cleaning / good form) with Niacin. Therefore, the anti-atherogenic effects of HDL occur by reverse cholesterol transport of oxidized LDL cholesterol, resulting in restoring part or all of endothelial cell function. (<em>Endothelial cells are the lining in your artery walls</em>).

Niacin has been shown to raise HDL (good cholesterol) by as much as 30-35%. It can also reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) particle size (a good thing) from small dense pattern B to larger non-atherogenic pattern A.

Generally we recommend 1 – 3 grams of Niacin per day (See Ref: Baylor University Medical Proceedings p 126, Vol. 26, No. 2).

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>HGH / IGF-1: HGH is another important component to reversing heart disease with a plant-based diet and niacin.
</strong></h3>
We all know that obesity is strongly correlated to heart disease. Epidemiological studies demonstrate an increase in coronary heart disease mortality in men and women with higher than average body mass indexes. What’s more, obesity is strongly related to cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia.

In the famous Dr. Rudman study on HGH in men over 60 years of age, it was found that decreased levels of growth hormone secretion is responsible in part to a decrease in lean body mass, and an increase in fat tissue mass. HGH replacement therapy helps aging men and women maintain more muscle mass and less fat, resulting in an overall improved body composition.

It’s also been shown that diabetic women who use natural bio-identical hormone replacement therapy are more likely to have their blood glucose under control and have lower cholesterol levels.

In recent studies it has been shown that short courses of growth hormone replacement therapy reduced LDL (bad cholesterol). That’s good, as we want bad cholesterol to be below 60 mg/dL ideally.

HGH shows improvements in exercise capacity and cardiac function. Those undergoing HGH replacement therapy show increased oxygen uptake and power output during exercise. Echocardiography has shown that left ventricular muscle mass index, fractional shortening, and fiber shortening velocity all improve after 6 months of low-dose HGH therapy.

Cardiovascular symptoms of growth hormone deficiency include:
<ul>
 	<li>Hardened vessels (sclerosis of vessel wall).</li>
 	<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>
 	<li>Reduced NO-production</li>
 	<li>Increased fibrinogen and PAI-1</li>
 	<li>Hypertension</li>
</ul>
Ref: A4M Michael Klentze, MD, PhD p 418

These factors along with overall body composition attest to the benefits of supporting a heart healthy diet with niacin and HGH replacement therapies. For those with heart disease or for those who wish to live longer without heart disease, we can help. Heart disease can be avoided and reversed with a whole food plant based diet. Outcomes can be improved and accelerated with additional HGH and Niacin supplementation.]]></content:encoded>

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee,take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Four test playing nations. A former World Number One lost its way to experience one of the lowest points in the annals of their sporting history. In recent times, a supremely insurmountable side at home became more prone to defeats. A team famously regarded as the most volatile side to have taken the field endured isolation and wilderness in the Arabian deserts. A team deemed misfit started making significant strides that the world took note of. These are tumultuous yet exciting times for the test playing nations from the subcontinent.

One day, the leaves wither as they turn old. India and Sri Lanka are primarily experiencing this phase. There are more greens on their tree today. Pakistan is almost in a situation where the leaves are about to fall. The cricketing expiry for Misbah and Younus is much closer than what it was yesterday. Take the story of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, for example. The chances of comeback become slim for the veteran sportsmen moment the form slips away. As long as the fire in the lamp withstands the external pressure of the winds, these legendary players can continue writing more pages in their autobiographies.

&nbsp;

India, now in the Sri Lankan shores, are all set to be challenged in conditions they are more familiar of. Ever since the dramatic 8-0 whitewashes in 2011-12, India showed mild signs of recovery. They have had to reshuffle the batting line up ever since the glorious trinity signed off along with the famous Delhi openers who seem to have lost their mojo. Fortunately, they have managed to construct another batting order which a lot of top ranked test countries can feel jealous about. But that’s about the best part of the segment that the team can feel proud of. As a unit, the losses at South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia meant that the slide wasn’t arrested. With the one-off Bangladesh test abandoned due to rain, this Lankan tour is the beginning of a two year journey around the rivers and mountains of the sub-continent.

With a new leader and with the Board all set to soon announce the new coach, who would be the man to plot the route map for the future, India’s test resurgence is in tricky waters. The followers of the sport in the mad nation have had a long break since the IPL. Since IPL they have had to endure an ignominious one-day tour of Bangladesh. It has been the longest break for the team for a long time. Kohli has promised that he will play five bowlers thus thrusting more responsibility both on the top and the lower order batsmen. So far, Kohli’s approach as a leader has been all about making the moves to create a positive result. The aggressive attitude now goes a step further to embolden and empower the players with more trust and responsibility. It is time for his players to contribute with a very conscious mindset craving for consistency. With more matches scheduled in the sub-continent, the onus would be on the spinners to take lead with the attack.

On the other side of the border, Pakistan’s resurgence in test cricket has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is no easy task to defend at the adopted home as well as to beat the Lankans in their territory. Significantly, the batsmen contributed crucial runs for their bowlers to pick twenty wickets. After a relentless search for steady batsmen who build their game on temperament, Pakistan seem to have solved the puzzle. Ahmed Shehzad’s ability to convert starts into hundreds has provided a reasonable stability at the top of the order. Shan Masood, is still very young. But he showed enough gumption to convince about his ability and temperament. Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali have been the biggest finds for Pakistan cricket in recent times. They have been the pillars around whom the game revolves. The best part about the two is that, they emerge from a different school of cricket where calmness and patience are considered as stepping stones for success. Shafiq and Ali have both tasted success and have good knowledge of what it takes to score hundreds in test matches. Between Shafiq and Ali, come the most experienced Pakistani pair of Younus Khan and Misbah Ul Haq. While they both don’t seem to come close to an end with their careers, Pakistan’s fresh approach in ODIs gives a good look into their batting resources when the legends call it a day. That Pakistan completed a rout in Sri Lanka, defeating the hosts in all formats of the game, shows that the team is experiencing a positive growth. After the final T20, there were great scenes of camaraderie and team bonding. Importantly, Pakistan have showed that they enough stomach for challenge and hunger for victory.

The inclusion of Sarfaraz Ahmed in the middle order is the single most powerful addition for their line-up. Teams are prone to produce inconsistent results if they carry a lot of flashy batsmen. Such batsmen will change the complexion of the game within a session or two. Since their approach can’t be tempered, it would be difficult to expect them play a fighting innings. Sarfaraz, amazingly, can play both roles. He has lent fire to the batting order that finally found solidity and method to their game.

While Pakistan need not worry about the fast bowler produce, Saeed Ajmal’s exit from the scene could have spelt dooms for any team. Yasir Shah’s emergence as an attacking leg spinner smoothened the transition. Yasir Shah provides Misbah with both control and strike force. When the batsmen succeed, Shah becomes a bigger prospect for Pakistan’s success. The way he bowled in Sri Lanka on not so friendly surfaces was a display of his stern character and his ability to play according to the conditions.

Pakistan’s biggest challenge, though, is yet to arrive. They have slowly begun to become a strong opponent in home conditions. But just like how the challenge was for India, or for that matter any other subcontinent team, Pakistan’s ability to survive and succeed will be tested on a bigger scale when they play in Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand.

The latest victim of the Bangladesh assault were the South Africans. Not so long ago, Bangladesh gave both India and Pakistan a rude lesson that told the world that they have finally arrived. While Bangladesh’s resurgence has mostly been in the ODIs, they made some impression when they bowled out South Africa for under 250 and took an important lead in the first test at Dhaka. The promise that Bangladesh have shown in the past six months only makes us believe that the team has matured heads who are ready to act responsibly for team’s success now. At the helm of affairs is Hathurusinghe, who is carving a legacy of his own with this resurgence. The coach has gone the long yards to make his team believe that they definitely can. The likes of Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mashrafe Mortaza have absorbed enough quality of international cricket, that they can be the torch bearers for Bangladesh cricket now. These players have shown immense maturity in taking ownership on the field and guiding the younger ones in the best way possible.

Considering the following that Bangladesh have in their backyard, it was going to be impossible for them to never improve. All this while, the stars who are torch bearers today were seeking inspiration to grow bigger. Their heroes never made it big. They got back home defeated again and again.

With Australia touring Bangladesh next, there wouldn’t be a better measure of their progress than testing it against Australia’s Gold Standard.

Sri Lanka have a problem aplenty. It is a mixed scenario that each of India and Pakistan have experienced for a long time. Under Angelo Mathews, this Lankan team is taking baby steps with their resurgence. The best aspect of this resurgence has been the performance of their fast bowlers. The tank is full with quality that Mathews can afford to prepare fast and seaming tracks for their bowlers to achieve desired results. Dhammika Prasad has come of age. Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal and Dushmantha Chameera have had their moments. Twenty three year old Chameera, especially, has come for a lot of praise. Along with the captain himself, Sri Lanka’s pace attack are in good shape for the present and for the immediate future.

But their real concerns come with their batsmen. Jayawardane is gone. Dilshan is gone. So will Sangakkara by the end of this month. While the batting has shown odd sparks with Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews continues to be the lynch pin in this batting order. The replacements and the next-in-line are the players who have been there with the team earlier. Jehan Mubarak’s and Upul Tharanga’s selections gives away the fact that the older men who were discarded before, continue to be the best of the lot to play test cricket. Sangakkara’s fear in the loss of quality in the first class cricket, is well placed. If the structure can’t produce new talents then there is something wrong that needs to be fixed at the earliest.

The Lankans trust Chandimal and Thirimanne a lot. While they have been impressive in shorter formats, both players need to raise their hands up now to shoulder responsibility. The series against India, is hence going to be very crucial for these two players. If both of them fail to make any mark, the middle order will be in tatters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Four test playing nations. A former World Number One lost its way to experience one of the lowest points in the annals of their sporting history. In recent times, a supremely insurmountable side at home became more prone to defeats. A team famously regarded as the most volatile side to have taken the field endured isolation and wilderness in the Arabian deserts. A team deemed misfit started making significant strides that the world took note of. These are tumultuous yet exciting times for the test playing nations from the subcontinent.

One day, the leaves wither as they turn old. India and Sri Lanka are primarily experiencing this phase. There are more greens on their tree today. Pakistan is almost in a situation where the leaves are about to fall. The cricketing expiry for Misbah and Younus is much closer than what it was yesterday. Take the story of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, for example. The chances of comeback become slim for the veteran sportsmen moment the form slips away. As long as the fire in the lamp withstands the external pressure of the winds, these legendary players can continue writing more pages in their autobiographies.

&nbsp;

India, now in the Sri Lankan shores, are all set to be challenged in conditions they are more familiar of. Ever since the dramatic 8-0 whitewashes in 2011-12, India showed mild signs of recovery. They have had to reshuffle the batting line up ever since the glorious trinity signed off along with the famous Delhi openers who seem to have lost their mojo. Fortunately, they have managed to construct another batting order which a lot of top ranked test countries can feel jealous about. But that’s about the best part of the segment that the team can feel proud of. As a unit, the losses at South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia meant that the slide wasn’t arrested. With the one-off Bangladesh test abandoned due to rain, this Lankan tour is the beginning of a two year journey around the rivers and mountains of the sub-continent.

With a new leader and with the Board all set to soon announce the new coach, who would be the man to plot the route map for the future, India’s test resurgence is in tricky waters. The followers of the sport in the mad nation have had a long break since the IPL. Since IPL they have had to endure an ignominious one-day tour of Bangladesh. It has been the longest break for the team for a long time. Kohli has promised that he will play five bowlers thus thrusting more responsibility both on the top and the lower order batsmen. So far, Kohli’s approach as a leader has been all about making the moves to create a positive result. The aggressive attitude now goes a step further to embolden and empower the players with more trust and responsibility. It is time for his players to contribute with a very conscious mindset craving for consistency. With more matches scheduled in the sub-continent, the onus would be on the spinners to take lead with the attack.

On the other side of the border, Pakistan’s resurgence in test cricket has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is no easy task to defend at the adopted home as well as to beat the Lankans in their territory. Significantly, the batsmen contributed crucial runs for their bowlers to pick twenty wickets. After a relentless search for steady batsmen who build their game on temperament, Pakistan seem to have solved the puzzle. Ahmed Shehzad’s ability to convert starts into hundreds has provided a reasonable stability at the top of the order. Shan Masood, is still very young. But he showed enough gumption to convince about his ability and temperament. Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali have been the biggest finds for Pakistan cricket in recent times. They have been the pillars around whom the game revolves. The best part about the two is that, they emerge from a different school of cricket where calmness and patience are considered as stepping stones for success. Shafiq and Ali have both tasted success and have good knowledge of what it takes to score hundreds in test matches. Between Shafiq and Ali, come the most experienced Pakistani pair of Younus Khan and Misbah Ul Haq. While they both don’t seem to come close to an end with their careers, Pakistan’s fresh approach in ODIs gives a good look into their batting resources when the legends call it a day. That Pakistan completed a rout in Sri Lanka, defeating the hosts in all formats of the game, shows that the team is experiencing a positive growth. After the final T20, there were great scenes of camaraderie and team bonding. Importantly, Pakistan have showed that they enough stomach for challenge and hunger for victory.

The inclusion of Sarfaraz Ahmed in the middle order is the single most powerful addition for their line-up. Teams are prone to produce inconsistent results if they carry a lot of flashy batsmen. Such batsmen will change the complexion of the game within a session or two. Since their approach can’t be tempered, it would be difficult to expect them play a fighting innings. Sarfaraz, amazingly, can play both roles. He has lent fire to the batting order that finally found solidity and method to their game.

While Pakistan need not worry about the fast bowler produce, Saeed Ajmal’s exit from the scene could have spelt dooms for any team. Yasir Shah’s emergence as an attacking leg spinner smoothened the transition. Yasir Shah provides Misbah with both control and strike force. When the batsmen succeed, Shah becomes a bigger prospect for Pakistan’s success. The way he bowled in Sri Lanka on not so friendly surfaces was a display of his stern character and his ability to play according to the conditions.

Pakistan’s biggest challenge, though, is yet to arrive. They have slowly begun to become a strong opponent in home conditions. But just like how the challenge was for India, or for that matter any other subcontinent team, Pakistan’s ability to survive and succeed will be tested on a bigger scale when they play in Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand.

The latest victim of the Bangladesh assault were the South Africans. Not so long ago, Bangladesh gave both India and Pakistan a rude lesson that told the world that they have finally arrived. While Bangladesh’s resurgence has mostly been in the ODIs, they made some impression when they bowled out South Africa for under 250 and took an important lead in the first test at Dhaka. The promise that Bangladesh have shown in the past six months only makes us believe that the team has matured heads who are ready to act responsibly for team’s success now. At the helm of affairs is Hathurusinghe, who is carving a legacy of his own with this resurgence. The coach has gone the long yards to make his team believe that they definitely can. The likes of Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mashrafe Mortaza have absorbed enough quality of international cricket, that they can be the torch bearers for Bangladesh cricket now. These players have shown immense maturity in taking ownership on the field and guiding the younger ones in the best way possible.

Considering the following that Bangladesh have in their backyard, it was going to be impossible for them to never improve. All this while, the stars who are torch bearers today were seeking inspiration to grow bigger. Their heroes never made it big. They got back home defeated again and again.

With Australia touring Bangladesh next, there wouldn’t be a better measure of their progress than testing it against Australia’s Gold Standard.

Sri Lanka have a problem aplenty. It is a mixed scenario that each of India and Pakistan have experienced for a long time. Under Angelo Mathews, this Lankan team is taking baby steps with their resurgence. The best aspect of this resurgence has been the performance of their fast bowlers. The tank is full with quality that Mathews can afford to prepare fast and seaming tracks for their bowlers to achieve desired results. Dhammika Prasad has come of age. Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal and Dushmantha Chameera have had their moments. Twenty three year old Chameera, especially, has come for a lot of praise. Along with the captain himself, Sri Lanka’s pace attack are in good shape for the present and for the immediate future.

But their real concerns come with their batsmen. Jayawardane is gone. Dilshan is gone. So will Sangakkara by the end of this month. While the batting has shown odd sparks with Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews continues to be the lynch pin in this batting order. The replacements and the next-in-line are the players who have been there with the team earlier. Jehan Mubarak’s and Upul Tharanga’s selections gives away the fact that the older men who were discarded before, continue to be the best of the lot to play test cricket. Sangakkara’s fear in the loss of quality in the first class cricket, is well placed. If the structure can’t produce new talents then there is something wrong that needs to be fixed at the earliest.

The Lankans trust Chandimal and Thirimanne a lot. While they have been impressive in shorter formats, both players need to raise their hands up now to shoulder responsibility. The series against India, is hence going to be very crucial for these two players. If both of them fail to make any mark, the middle order will be in tatters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do most doctors fully understand human physiology? At least to the degree they need to for public health and chronic disease? Most doctors think they know plenty about human physiology, but many don’t. In fact, many doctors are missing some of the most fundamental principles of how human physiology misfires when consuming the modern western diet, particularly too much meat and dairy. What most doctors are taught in medical school is a set of rules created more around pharmacological-based medicine and less about true evidenced-based medicine.

Is there a flaw or a conspiracy? Nobody can claim any one reason to the problem. Nevertheless, many of the rules governing how modern health care is taught and practiced can be linked back some 100 years earlier to the Flexner Report. The Flexner Report came out in the early 1900s and it still accounts for much of how medicine is controlled in the modern era. The report essentially enabled a few powerful global elites to insert themselves and their personal bias and beliefs into how the science and education of modern medicine is conducted and controlled in the United States, and fundamentally throughout the world. It may have done more harm than good, as it has led to a global epidemic of chronically sick human beings. This new generation of humans may be the first in history with a lifespan less than that of their parents.

This article is not about the Flexner Report or modern suppression of the scientific evidence related to the reversal of heart disease with diet and supplementation, which can accelerate the process. That can be explored another day. This blog is about using the evidence-based knowledge and research we currently have, and then applying it correctly to achieve the successful reversal of heart disease and possibly many other leading chronic diseases.
<h1>Reverse Heart Disease: Plant Based Diet, Niacin and HGH Therapy</h1>
Heart Disease Key Facts:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death globally each and every year.
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>It’s estimated that 17.5 million people died from cardiovascular disease in 2012. 7.4 million of these deaths were due to heart disease and 6.7 million caused by stroke.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Most (we would argue all) of these deaths are preventable with diet and lifestyle changes.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The good news is cardiovascular disease can be avoided. The better news is now it can be reversed, even in patients who are in the later stages of coronary artery disease.

One of the first clues we need to look at in our understanding of true human physiology is to explore why dogs don’t die of heart attacks. Is it because they eat only dog food? If you want to test this on your cardiologist, ask him the question below.
<blockquote><strong>The next time you’re sitting across from your cardiologist, ask him: “Dr., why don’t dogs die of heart attacks?” See how they respond!</strong></blockquote>
The answer is an easy one. It shows us a lot about how simple heart disease is to avoid, reverse, and RESOLVE!
<blockquote><strong>Atherosclerosis is easily produced experimentally in herbivores (rabbits) by giving them diets containing large quantities of cholesterol (egg yolks) or saturated fats (animal fats), while impossible to induce in tigers, lions and dogs!</strong></blockquote>
Armed with this information, most third graders can begin to solve the riddle of modern heart disease. Our epidemic of cardiovascular disease is mainly due to the level of animal based products we consume. Therefore, humans must be more physiologically associated to herbivores, so we should eat more similarly to herbivores than to carnivores if we want to protect ourselves from disease. This is profound to understanding how to manage, prevent and reverse cardiovascular disease properly. If we just eat fruits and vegetables, ideally a well planned healthy whole-food plant based diet, these diseases will decline and possibly disappear completely. That’s exactly what doctors Dean Ornish, M.D. and Caldwell Esselstyn, M.D. did in their published research on reversing heart disease.
<h3>Plant-Based Diet: A plant-based diet combined with Niacin and HGH replacement therapy can help reverse heart disease.</h3>
Read Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, MD research

Here are the rules to Dr. Esselstyn’s program in their simplest form taken from his book:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>You may not eat anything with a mother or a face (no meat, poultry, or fish).</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You cannot eat dairy products.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You must not consume oil of any kind— not a drop. (Yes, you devotees of the Mediterranean Diet, that includes olive oil)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Generally, you cannot eat nuts or avocados.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Esselstyn states further, you can eat a wonderful variety of delicious, nutrient-dense foods:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>All vegetables except avocado. Leafy green vegetables, root vegetables, veggies that are red, green, purple, orange, and yellow and everything in between.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All legumes— beans, peas, and lentils of all varieties. All whole grains and products, such as bread and pasta, that are made from them— as long as they do not contain added fats.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All fruits.– Esselstyn Jr. M.D., Caldwell B.. Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Basically, if you can navigate these rules, you can work with one of our nutritionists to build a heart healthy diet around these rules. For many, it may seem impossible, but once people learn there are a number of delicious recipes, a transformation in dietary habits can be taught and applied in a matter of a week or two. Dr. Dean Ornish found in his research that it usually required approximately 72 hours of instruction before it really begins to click in the minds of the patient.

To summarize Esselstyn: “Heart disease is nothing more than a paper tiger.” We agree. It is nothing more than working to keep total cholesterol around 150 mg/dL and LDL-c below 60 mg/dL. It’s been reported, that no one ever died of cardiovascular disease in the famous Framingham Heart Study with a total cholesterol of 150 or lower. That was a multi-generational study which began in the late 1940s and continued into the 1990s.

That’s about where the Esselstyn / Ornish style heart reversal programs end. A whole food plant based diet. What we can do in addition is combine other research, and those supplements shown in the research, to help accelerate and improve body composition and lipids (HGH and Niacin primarily), leading to better results sooner. This kind of program can be started at any of our international treatment centers under the supervision of a medical professional and counselors experienced in plant-based nutrition protocols.
<h3><strong>Niacin: Niacin is an important component for reversing heart disease with HGH and Diet
</strong></h3>
First we start with Niacin. Niacin is an inexpensive vitamin supplement. It’s one of the first supplements used to treat low HDL. HDL cholesterol is called the cleaning cholesterol. It’s the good cholesterol that helps remove the bad (LDL) cholesterol. This is a simple explanation, but more or less that’s what is going on inside your arteries. The good HDL helps clear the bad LDL. Treatment works to drive down LDL cholesterol (the oxidized / bad form ) with diet, and elevate the HDL cholesterol (cleaning / good form) with Niacin. Therefore, the anti-atherogenic effects of HDL occur by reverse cholesterol transport of oxidized LDL cholesterol, resulting in restoring part or all of endothelial cell function. (<em>Endothelial cells are the lining in your artery walls</em>).

Niacin has been shown to raise HDL (good cholesterol) by as much as 30-35%. It can also reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) particle size (a good thing) from small dense pattern B to larger non-atherogenic pattern A.

Generally we recommend 1 – 3 grams of Niacin per day (See Ref: Baylor University Medical Proceedings p 126, Vol. 26, No. 2).

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>HGH / IGF-1: HGH is another important component to reversing heart disease with a plant-based diet and niacin.
</strong></h3>
We all know that obesity is strongly correlated to heart disease. Epidemiological studies demonstrate an increase in coronary heart disease mortality in men and women with higher than average body mass indexes. What’s more, obesity is strongly related to cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia.

In the famous Dr. Rudman study on HGH in men over 60 years of age, it was found that decreased levels of growth hormone secretion is responsible in part to a decrease in lean body mass, and an increase in fat tissue mass. HGH replacement therapy helps aging men and women maintain more muscle mass and less fat, resulting in an overall improved body composition.

It’s also been shown that diabetic women who use natural bio-identical hormone replacement therapy are more likely to have their blood glucose under control and have lower cholesterol levels.

In recent studies it has been shown that short courses of growth hormone replacement therapy reduced LDL (bad cholesterol). That’s good, as we want bad cholesterol to be below 60 mg/dL ideally.

HGH shows improvements in exercise capacity and cardiac function. Those undergoing HGH replacement therapy show increased oxygen uptake and power output during exercise. Echocardiography has shown that left ventricular muscle mass index, fractional shortening, and fiber shortening velocity all improve after 6 months of low-dose HGH therapy.

Cardiovascular symptoms of growth hormone deficiency include:
<ul>
 	<li>Hardened vessels (sclerosis of vessel wall).</li>
 	<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>
 	<li>Reduced NO-production</li>
 	<li>Increased fibrinogen and PAI-1</li>
 	<li>Hypertension</li>
</ul>
Ref: A4M Michael Klentze, MD, PhD p 418

These factors along with overall body composition attest to the benefits of supporting a heart healthy diet with niacin and HGH replacement therapies. For those with heart disease or for those who wish to live longer without heart disease, we can help. Heart disease can be avoided and reversed with a whole food plant based diet. Outcomes can be improved and accelerated with additional HGH and Niacin supplementation.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At least to the degree they need to for public health and chronic disease? Most doctors think they know plenty about human physiology, but many don’t. In fact, many doctors are missing some of the most fundamental principles of how human physiology misfires when consuming the modern western diet, particularly too much meat and dairy. What most doctors are taught in medical school is a set of rules created more around pharmacological-based medicine and less about true evidenced-based medicine.

Is there a flaw or a conspiracy? Nobody can claim any one reason to the problem. Nevertheless, many of the rules governing how modern health care is taught and practiced can be linked back some 100 years earlier to the Flexner Report. The Flexner Report came out in the early 1900s and it still accounts for much of how medicine is controlled in the modern era. The report essentially enabled a few powerful global elites to insert themselves and their personal bias and beliefs into how the science and education of modern medicine is conducted and controlled in the United States, and fundamentally throughout the world. It may have done more harm than good, as it has led to a global epidemic of chronically sick human beings. This new generation of humans may be the first in history with a lifespan less than that of their parents.

This article is not about the Flexner Report or modern suppression of the scientific evidence related to the reversal of heart disease with diet and supplementation, which can accelerate the process. That can be explored another day. This blog is about using the evidence-based knowledge and research we currently have, and then applying it correctly to achieve the successful reversal of heart disease and possibly many other leading chronic diseases.
<h1>Reverse Heart Disease: Plant Based Diet, Niacin and HGH Therapy</h1>
Heart Disease Key Facts:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death globally each and every year.
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>It’s estimated that 17.5 million people died from cardiovascular disease in 2012. 7.4 million of these deaths were due to heart disease and 6.7 million caused by stroke.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Most (we would argue all) of these deaths are preventable with diet and lifestyle changes.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The good news is cardiovascular disease can be avoided. The better news is now it can be reversed, even in patients who are in the later stages of coronary artery disease.

One of the first clues we need to look at in our understanding of true human physiology is to explore why dogs don’t die of heart attacks. Is it because they eat only dog food? If you want to test this on your cardiologist, ask him the question below.
<blockquote><strong>The next time you’re sitting across from your cardiologist, ask him: “Dr., why don’t dogs die of heart attacks?” See how they respond!</strong></blockquote>
The answer is an easy one. It shows us a lot about how simple heart disease is to avoid, reverse, and RESOLVE!
<blockquote><strong>Atherosclerosis is easily produced experimentally in herbivores (rabbits) by giving them diets containing large quantities of cholesterol (egg yolks) or saturated fats (animal fats), while impossible to induce in tigers, lions and dogs!</strong></blockquote>
Armed with this information, most third graders can begin to solve the riddle of modern heart disease. Our epidemic of cardiovascular disease is mainly due to the level of animal based products we consume. Therefore, humans must be more physiologically associated to herbivores, so we should eat more similarly to herbivores than to carnivores if we want to protect ourselves from disease. This is profound to understanding how to manage, prevent and reverse cardiovascular disease properly. If we just eat fruits and vegetables, ideally a well planned healthy whole-food plant based diet, these diseases will decline and possibly disappear completely. That’s exactly what doctors Dean Ornish, M.D. and Caldwell Esselstyn, M.D. did in their published research on reversing heart disease.
<h3>Plant-Based Diet: A plant-based diet combined with Niacin and HGH replacement therapy can help reverse heart disease.</h3>
Read Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, MD research

Here are the rules to Dr. Esselstyn’s program in their simplest form taken from his book:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>You may not eat anything with a mother or a face (no meat, poultry, or fish).</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You cannot eat dairy products.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You must not consume oil of any kind— not a drop. (Yes, you devotees of the Mediterranean Diet, that includes olive oil)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Generally, you cannot eat nuts or avocados.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Esselstyn states further, you can eat a wonderful variety of delicious, nutrient-dense foods:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>All vegetables except avocado. Leafy green vegetables, root vegetables, veggies that are red, green, purple, orange, and yellow and everything in between.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All legumes— beans, peas, and lentils of all varieties. All whole grains and products, such as bread and pasta, that are made from them— as long as they do not contain added fats.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All fruits.– Esselstyn Jr. M.D., Caldwell B.. Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Basically, if you can navigate these rules, you can work with one of our nutritionists to build a heart healthy diet around these rules. For many, it may seem impossible, but once people learn there are a number of delicious recipes, a transformation in dietary habits can be taught and applied in a matter of a week or two. Dr. Dean Ornish found in his research that it usually required approximately 72 hours of instruction before it really begins to click in the minds of the patient.

To summarize Esselstyn: “Heart disease is nothing more than a paper tiger.” We agree. It is nothing more than working to keep total cholesterol around 150 mg/dL and LDL-c below 60 mg/dL. It’s been reported, that no one ever died of cardiovascular disease in the famous Framingham Heart Study with a total cholesterol of 150 or lower. That was a multi-generational study which began in the late 1940s and continued into the 1990s.

That’s about where the Esselstyn / Ornish style heart reversal programs end. A whole food plant based diet. What we can do in addition is combine other research, and those supplements shown in the research, to help accelerate and improve body composition and lipids (HGH and Niacin primarily), leading to better results sooner. This kind of program can be started at any of our international treatment centers under the supervision of a medical professional and counselors experienced in plant-based nutrition protocols.
<h3><strong>Niacin: Niacin is an important component for reversing heart disease with HGH and Diet
</strong></h3>
First we start with Niacin. Niacin is an inexpensive vitamin supplement. It’s one of the first supplements used to treat low HDL. HDL cholesterol is called the cleaning cholesterol. It’s the good cholesterol that helps remove the bad (LDL) cholesterol. This is a simple explanation, but more or less that’s what is going on inside your arteries. The good HDL helps clear the bad LDL. Treatment works to drive down LDL cholesterol (the oxidized / bad form ) with diet, and elevate the HDL cholesterol (cleaning / good form) with Niacin. Therefore, the anti-atherogenic effects of HDL occur by reverse cholesterol transport of oxidized LDL cholesterol, resulting in restoring part or all of endothelial cell function. (<em>Endothelial cells are the lining in your artery walls</em>).

Niacin has been shown to raise HDL (good cholesterol) by as much as 30-35%. It can also reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) particle size (a good thing) from small dense pattern B to larger non-atherogenic pattern A.

Generally we recommend 1 – 3 grams of Niacin per day (See Ref: Baylor University Medical Proceedings p 126, Vol. 26, No. 2).

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>HGH / IGF-1: HGH is another important component to reversing heart disease with a plant-based diet and niacin.
</strong></h3>
We all know that obesity is strongly correlated to heart disease. Epidemiological studies demonstrate an increase in coronary heart disease mortality in men and women with higher than average body mass indexes. What’s more, obesity is strongly related to cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia.

In the famous Dr. Rudman study on HGH in men over 60 years of age, it was found that decreased levels of growth hormone secretion is responsible in part to a decrease in lean body mass, and an increase in fat tissue mass. HGH replacement therapy helps aging men and women maintain more muscle mass and less fat, resulting in an overall improved body composition.

It’s also been shown that diabetic women who use natural bio-identical hormone replacement therapy are more likely to have their blood glucose under control and have lower cholesterol levels.

In recent studies it has been shown that short courses of growth hormone replacement therapy reduced LDL (bad cholesterol). That’s good, as we want bad cholesterol to be below 60 mg/dL ideally.

HGH shows improvements in exercise capacity and cardiac function. Those undergoing HGH replacement therapy show increased oxygen uptake and power output during exercise. Echocardiography has shown that left ventricular muscle mass index, fractional shortening, and fiber shortening velocity all improve after 6 months of low-dose HGH therapy.

Cardiovascular symptoms of growth hormone deficiency include:
<ul>
 	<li>Hardened vessels (sclerosis of vessel wall).</li>
 	<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>
 	<li>Reduced NO-production</li>
 	<li>Increased fibrinogen and PAI-1</li>
 	<li>Hypertension</li>
</ul>
Ref: A4M Michael Klentze, MD, PhD p 418

These factors along with overall body composition attest to the benefits of supporting a heart healthy diet with niacin and HGH replacement therapies. For those with heart disease or for those who wish to live longer without heart disease, we can help. Heart disease can be avoided and reversed with a whole food plant based diet. Outcomes can be improved and accelerated with additional HGH and Niacin supplementation.]]></content:encoded>

It’s kind of confusing because I’m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I’m not the biggest girl on the market but I’m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating.

They released me in this campaign with everyone else there no distinction. It’s not a separate section for plus size girls she says.

There was a time in the industry not too long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was using plus size models as a headline-grabbing gimmick see the groundbreaking <a href="#">Italian Vogue</a> cover featuring Tara Lynn, Candice Huffine, and Robyn Lawley in June 2016.long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was.

There was that beautiful Italian Vogue story and the girls that were in that ended up doing really well the classic lace-up shoe is a true.

I feel like for a minute, it was starting to feel like this plus size I’m not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls really was a trend.

That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.
<h5><strong>WordPress a difficult game because everyone wants to be cool in fashion.</strong></h5>
Now, Dalbesio is a bit more hopeful about size in the modeling industry ma quande lingues coalesce. In the middle Occidental in fact she says not skinny enough.That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant right to find fault pleasure?

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee,take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Four test playing nations. A former World Number One lost its way to experience one of the lowest points in the annals of their sporting history. In recent times, a supremely insurmountable side at home became more prone to defeats. A team famously regarded as the most volatile side to have taken the field endured isolation and wilderness in the Arabian deserts. A team deemed misfit started making significant strides that the world took note of. These are tumultuous yet exciting times for the test playing nations from the subcontinent.

One day, the leaves wither as they turn old. India and Sri Lanka are primarily experiencing this phase. There are more greens on their tree today. Pakistan is almost in a situation where the leaves are about to fall. The cricketing expiry for Misbah and Younus is much closer than what it was yesterday. Take the story of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, for example. The chances of comeback become slim for the veteran sportsmen moment the form slips away. As long as the fire in the lamp withstands the external pressure of the winds, these legendary players can continue writing more pages in their autobiographies.

&nbsp;

India, now in the Sri Lankan shores, are all set to be challenged in conditions they are more familiar of. Ever since the dramatic 8-0 whitewashes in 2011-12, India showed mild signs of recovery. They have had to reshuffle the batting line up ever since the glorious trinity signed off along with the famous Delhi openers who seem to have lost their mojo. Fortunately, they have managed to construct another batting order which a lot of top ranked test countries can feel jealous about. But that’s about the best part of the segment that the team can feel proud of. As a unit, the losses at South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia meant that the slide wasn’t arrested. With the one-off Bangladesh test abandoned due to rain, this Lankan tour is the beginning of a two year journey around the rivers and mountains of the sub-continent.

With a new leader and with the Board all set to soon announce the new coach, who would be the man to plot the route map for the future, India’s test resurgence is in tricky waters. The followers of the sport in the mad nation have had a long break since the IPL. Since IPL they have had to endure an ignominious one-day tour of Bangladesh. It has been the longest break for the team for a long time. Kohli has promised that he will play five bowlers thus thrusting more responsibility both on the top and the lower order batsmen. So far, Kohli’s approach as a leader has been all about making the moves to create a positive result. The aggressive attitude now goes a step further to embolden and empower the players with more trust and responsibility. It is time for his players to contribute with a very conscious mindset craving for consistency. With more matches scheduled in the sub-continent, the onus would be on the spinners to take lead with the attack.

On the other side of the border, Pakistan’s resurgence in test cricket has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is no easy task to defend at the adopted home as well as to beat the Lankans in their territory. Significantly, the batsmen contributed crucial runs for their bowlers to pick twenty wickets. After a relentless search for steady batsmen who build their game on temperament, Pakistan seem to have solved the puzzle. Ahmed Shehzad’s ability to convert starts into hundreds has provided a reasonable stability at the top of the order. Shan Masood, is still very young. But he showed enough gumption to convince about his ability and temperament. Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali have been the biggest finds for Pakistan cricket in recent times. They have been the pillars around whom the game revolves. The best part about the two is that, they emerge from a different school of cricket where calmness and patience are considered as stepping stones for success. Shafiq and Ali have both tasted success and have good knowledge of what it takes to score hundreds in test matches. Between Shafiq and Ali, come the most experienced Pakistani pair of Younus Khan and Misbah Ul Haq. While they both don’t seem to come close to an end with their careers, Pakistan’s fresh approach in ODIs gives a good look into their batting resources when the legends call it a day. That Pakistan completed a rout in Sri Lanka, defeating the hosts in all formats of the game, shows that the team is experiencing a positive growth. After the final T20, there were great scenes of camaraderie and team bonding. Importantly, Pakistan have showed that they enough stomach for challenge and hunger for victory.

The inclusion of Sarfaraz Ahmed in the middle order is the single most powerful addition for their line-up. Teams are prone to produce inconsistent results if they carry a lot of flashy batsmen. Such batsmen will change the complexion of the game within a session or two. Since their approach can’t be tempered, it would be difficult to expect them play a fighting innings. Sarfaraz, amazingly, can play both roles. He has lent fire to the batting order that finally found solidity and method to their game.

While Pakistan need not worry about the fast bowler produce, Saeed Ajmal’s exit from the scene could have spelt dooms for any team. Yasir Shah’s emergence as an attacking leg spinner smoothened the transition. Yasir Shah provides Misbah with both control and strike force. When the batsmen succeed, Shah becomes a bigger prospect for Pakistan’s success. The way he bowled in Sri Lanka on not so friendly surfaces was a display of his stern character and his ability to play according to the conditions.

Pakistan’s biggest challenge, though, is yet to arrive. They have slowly begun to become a strong opponent in home conditions. But just like how the challenge was for India, or for that matter any other subcontinent team, Pakistan’s ability to survive and succeed will be tested on a bigger scale when they play in Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand.

The latest victim of the Bangladesh assault were the South Africans. Not so long ago, Bangladesh gave both India and Pakistan a rude lesson that told the world that they have finally arrived. While Bangladesh’s resurgence has mostly been in the ODIs, they made some impression when they bowled out South Africa for under 250 and took an important lead in the first test at Dhaka. The promise that Bangladesh have shown in the past six months only makes us believe that the team has matured heads who are ready to act responsibly for team’s success now. At the helm of affairs is Hathurusinghe, who is carving a legacy of his own with this resurgence. The coach has gone the long yards to make his team believe that they definitely can. The likes of Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mashrafe Mortaza have absorbed enough quality of international cricket, that they can be the torch bearers for Bangladesh cricket now. These players have shown immense maturity in taking ownership on the field and guiding the younger ones in the best way possible.

Considering the following that Bangladesh have in their backyard, it was going to be impossible for them to never improve. All this while, the stars who are torch bearers today were seeking inspiration to grow bigger. Their heroes never made it big. They got back home defeated again and again.

With Australia touring Bangladesh next, there wouldn’t be a better measure of their progress than testing it against Australia’s Gold Standard.

Sri Lanka have a problem aplenty. It is a mixed scenario that each of India and Pakistan have experienced for a long time. Under Angelo Mathews, this Lankan team is taking baby steps with their resurgence. The best aspect of this resurgence has been the performance of their fast bowlers. The tank is full with quality that Mathews can afford to prepare fast and seaming tracks for their bowlers to achieve desired results. Dhammika Prasad has come of age. Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal and Dushmantha Chameera have had their moments. Twenty three year old Chameera, especially, has come for a lot of praise. Along with the captain himself, Sri Lanka’s pace attack are in good shape for the present and for the immediate future.

But their real concerns come with their batsmen. Jayawardane is gone. Dilshan is gone. So will Sangakkara by the end of this month. While the batting has shown odd sparks with Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews continues to be the lynch pin in this batting order. The replacements and the next-in-line are the players who have been there with the team earlier. Jehan Mubarak’s and Upul Tharanga’s selections gives away the fact that the older men who were discarded before, continue to be the best of the lot to play test cricket. Sangakkara’s fear in the loss of quality in the first class cricket, is well placed. If the structure can’t produce new talents then there is something wrong that needs to be fixed at the earliest.

The Lankans trust Chandimal and Thirimanne a lot. While they have been impressive in shorter formats, both players need to raise their hands up now to shoulder responsibility. The series against India, is hence going to be very crucial for these two players. If both of them fail to make any mark, the middle order will be in tatters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Four test playing nations. A former World Number One lost its way to experience one of the lowest points in the annals of their sporting history. In recent times, a supremely insurmountable side at home became more prone to defeats. A team famously regarded as the most volatile side to have taken the field endured isolation and wilderness in the Arabian deserts. A team deemed misfit started making significant strides that the world took note of. These are tumultuous yet exciting times for the test playing nations from the subcontinent.<span id="more-961"></span>

One day, the leaves wither as they turn old. India and Sri Lanka are primarily experiencing this phase. There are more greens on their tree today. Pakistan is almost in a situation where the leaves are about to fall. The cricketing expiry for Misbah and Younus is much closer than what it was yesterday. Take the story of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, for example. The chances of comeback become slim for the veteran sportsmen moment the form slips away. As long as the fire in the lamp withstands the external pressure of the winds, these legendary players can continue writing more pages in their autobiographies.

&nbsp;

India, now in the Sri Lankan shores, are all set to be challenged in conditions they are more familiar of. Ever since the dramatic 8-0 whitewashes in 2011-12, India showed mild signs of recovery. They have had to reshuffle the batting line up ever since the glorious trinity signed off along with the famous Delhi openers who seem to have lost their mojo. Fortunately, they have managed to construct another batting order which a lot of top ranked test countries can feel jealous about. But that’s about the best part of the segment that the team can feel proud of. As a unit, the losses at South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia meant that the slide wasn’t arrested. With the one-off Bangladesh test abandoned due to rain, this Lankan tour is the beginning of a two year journey around the rivers and mountains of the sub-continent.

With a new leader and with the Board all set to soon announce the new coach, who would be the man to plot the route map for the future, India’s test resurgence is in tricky waters. The followers of the sport in the mad nation have had a long break since the IPL. Since IPL they have had to endure an ignominious one-day tour of Bangladesh. It has been the longest break for the team for a long time. Kohli has promised that he will play five bowlers thus thrusting more responsibility both on the top and the lower order batsmen. So far, Kohli’s approach as a leader has been all about making the moves to create a positive result. The aggressive attitude now goes a step further to embolden and empower the players with more trust and responsibility. It is time for his players to contribute with a very conscious mindset craving for consistency. With more matches scheduled in the sub-continent, the onus would be on the spinners to take lead with the attack.

On the other side of the border, Pakistan’s resurgence in test cricket has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is no easy task to defend at the adopted home as well as to beat the Lankans in their territory. Significantly, the batsmen contributed crucial runs for their bowlers to pick twenty wickets. After a relentless search for steady batsmen who build their game on temperament, Pakistan seem to have solved the puzzle. Ahmed Shehzad’s ability to convert starts into hundreds has provided a reasonable stability at the top of the order. Shan Masood, is still very young. But he showed enough gumption to convince about his ability and temperament. Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali have been the biggest finds for Pakistan cricket in recent times. They have been the pillars around whom the game revolves. The best part about the two is that, they emerge from a different school of cricket where calmness and patience are considered as stepping stones for success. Shafiq and Ali have both tasted success and have good knowledge of what it takes to score hundreds in test matches. Between Shafiq and Ali, come the most experienced Pakistani pair of Younus Khan and Misbah Ul Haq. While they both don’t seem to come close to an end with their careers, Pakistan’s fresh approach in ODIs gives a good look into their batting resources when the legends call it a day. That Pakistan completed a rout in Sri Lanka, defeating the hosts in all formats of the game, shows that the team is experiencing a positive growth. After the final T20, there were great scenes of camaraderie and team bonding. Importantly, Pakistan have showed that they enough stomach for challenge and hunger for victory.

The inclusion of Sarfaraz Ahmed in the middle order is the single most powerful addition for their line-up. Teams are prone to produce inconsistent results if they carry a lot of flashy batsmen. Such batsmen will change the complexion of the game within a session or two. Since their approach can’t be tempered, it would be difficult to expect them play a fighting innings. Sarfaraz, amazingly, can play both roles. He has lent fire to the batting order that finally found solidity and method to their game.

While Pakistan need not worry about the fast bowler produce, Saeed Ajmal’s exit from the scene could have spelt dooms for any team. Yasir Shah’s emergence as an attacking leg spinner smoothened the transition. Yasir Shah provides Misbah with both control and strike force. When the batsmen succeed, Shah becomes a bigger prospect for Pakistan’s success. The way he bowled in Sri Lanka on not so friendly surfaces was a display of his stern character and his ability to play according to the conditions.

Pakistan’s biggest challenge, though, is yet to arrive. They have slowly begun to become a strong opponent in home conditions. But just like how the challenge was for India, or for that matter any other subcontinent team, Pakistan’s ability to survive and succeed will be tested on a bigger scale when they play in Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand.

The latest victim of the Bangladesh assault were the South Africans. Not so long ago, Bangladesh gave both India and Pakistan a rude lesson that told the world that they have finally arrived. While Bangladesh’s resurgence has mostly been in the ODIs, they made some impression when they bowled out South Africa for under 250 and took an important lead in the first test at Dhaka. The promise that Bangladesh have shown in the past six months only makes us believe that the team has matured heads who are ready to act responsibly for team’s success now. At the helm of affairs is Hathurusinghe, who is carving a legacy of his own with this resurgence. The coach has gone the long yards to make his team believe that they definitely can. The likes of Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mashrafe Mortaza have absorbed enough quality of international cricket, that they can be the torch bearers for Bangladesh cricket now. These players have shown immense maturity in taking ownership on the field and guiding the younger ones in the best way possible.

Considering the following that Bangladesh have in their backyard, it was going to be impossible for them to never improve. All this while, the stars who are torch bearers today were seeking inspiration to grow bigger. Their heroes never made it big. They got back home defeated again and again.

With Australia touring Bangladesh next, there wouldn’t be a better measure of their progress than testing it against Australia’s Gold Standard.

Sri Lanka have a problem aplenty. It is a mixed scenario that each of India and Pakistan have experienced for a long time. Under Angelo Mathews, this Lankan team is taking baby steps with their resurgence. The best aspect of this resurgence has been the performance of their fast bowlers. The tank is full with quality that Mathews can afford to prepare fast and seaming tracks for their bowlers to achieve desired results. Dhammika Prasad has come of age. Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal and Dushmantha Chameera have had their moments. Twenty three year old Chameera, especially, has come for a lot of praise. Along with the captain himself, Sri Lanka’s pace attack are in good shape for the present and for the immediate future.

But their real concerns come with their batsmen. Jayawardane is gone. Dilshan is gone. So will Sangakkara by the end of this month. While the batting has shown odd sparks with Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews continues to be the lynch pin in this batting order. The replacements and the next-in-line are the players who have been there with the team earlier. Jehan Mubarak’s and Upul Tharanga’s selections gives away the fact that the older men who were discarded before, continue to be the best of the lot to play test cricket. Sangakkara’s fear in the loss of quality in the first class cricket, is well placed. If the structure can’t produce new talents then there is something wrong that needs to be fixed at the earliest.

The Lankans trust Chandimal and Thirimanne a lot. While they have been impressive in shorter formats, both players need to raise their hands up now to shoulder responsibility. The series against India, is hence going to be very crucial for these two players. If both of them fail to make any mark, the middle order will be in tatters.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This lyric, written 50 years ago about another time could apply to our world now. What we understood about the sixties revolution after it happened was that it was a reaction to a deep unhappiness with the established order that had brought two world wars. People didn’t know what exactly they wanted, but they certainly didn’t want what they had come to see as normal.

Now, five months into Donald Trump’s America, as we watch Brexit threaten the foundations of the European Union and stand appalled at increasingly nihilistic Islamist terrorism it is clear something is happening. The old order is crumbling. That’s easy to interpret. The difficult part is who is opposing who? It is a fast emerging conflict, but broadly it is between opportunist, populist, revanchist and nationalistic politicians and their followers against the ancient regime of liberal, consensus leaning, globalist internationalists.

President Trump is the standard bearer for the first group, but he has fellow travelers in Britain and across Europe. This, let us call it a movement, is not slavishly committed to political correctness or multiculturalism. Russia is being connected to Trump by the Western media. But a lot of this is down to the fact that Vladimir Putin, too, refuses to kow tow to the second group.

For the last 30 years liberal, consensus driven, globalist politics dominated the rich, influential power blocs. The United States and the European Union (EU) through the 1980s and 1990s dominated world politics. And the two power blocs, intertwined with the military alliance of NATO and supported by the United Nations formed one all dominating, usually cohesive conglomerate.

The EU, though it expanded to 27 countries, and was supposed to represent a homogenous group was and is dominated by an axis of Germany and France. The EU will not deviate toward policy that adversely affects the interests of this axis.

The United Kingdom stood up to the French-German axis, and now it has left. Russia, re-emerging with confidence, would not be intimidated. But all this the EU and its dominating powers could handle. Then Trump became US President. This wild card has blown all the old certainties away.

Rapidly the accepted pillars of global politics have crumbled. The old way of doing things, driven by the liberal democracies and leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel was stuttering. A week ago, in a Bavarian Beer Hall, Angela Merkel was driven to say: <em>“The times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent over.”</em>

Merkel supporters – and even her internal enemies – nodded at her bellicose language.

She was saying that Trump’s America, the ‘want away’ British and the cynical Russians and everybody else can’t be relied on anymore. They disagree, and they must be wrong. There is a general acceptance in the global, opinion setting liberal media that these three power blocs have wronged the EU power brokers.

This scolding from Merkel was inspired by Trump’s tour through Europe when he did some scolding of his own.

At a G7 meeting in Sicily Trump criticized America’s traditional European allies over NATO obligations and made clear that he was willing to go it alone on climate change and trade.

The Old Guard, led by Germany its close EU colleagues, are characterizing Trump, the British and other nations and political movements who oppose them as right wing and reactionary. The language of their criticism carries innuendo. Those who oppose them are violent, racist and backward thinking. The narrative from the European leaders in the EU to the departing British has been that they are a nation of fools led by inward looking politicians.

America too is, they say, a misguided country led by a backward, isolationist leader in Donald Trump. These views are strongly supported by large swathes of the media. The Western media is predominantly liberal, leftist and supportive of consensus politics.

I contend that it is the consensus, liberal politicians that are out of step. It is they who are suddenly seen to be tied to an out-of-date and exhausted ideology. The reaction of the European democracies to Trump indicates history has overtaken them.

Trump said at a NATO meeting in Brussels at the end of May <em>“NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations.”</em>

And it was met with shock.

Trump has been castigating NATO and the unwillingness of America’s partners to spend the required 2 percent of GDP on defense for well over a year now. He has driven it home time after time.

I was in Washington when he told Merkel to her face about his concerns.

When Trump last week pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord there was a worldwide shrill revulsion.

Belatedly some thinkers and writers have come to see that the reaction to this was over the top. Again, amazingly, many world leaders and commentators have not been listening to what Trump has been saying. Or why he is saying it.

He has opposed this deal since he rose to become a Presidential contender a year ago.

His castigation of NATO is not some mindless attack on old allies. It is a deep belief that America is being taken advantage of. America First he says and he means it.

His exit from the Paris deal is down to the fact that he believes it is a bad deal for America. And many agree with him.

And we get to back to basic politics. Trump was elected in the Rust Belt of the United States. And Greater Appalachia, a huge neglected, mainly white area in the middle of the United States that has been wonderfully chronicled in the Hillbilly Elegy memoir of JD Vance.

Trump believes the Paris Accord is unfair. It is bad for the US, it is bad for the US coal industry, and it is bad for the working class folk in the middle America states that elected him. And he is out.

When he accompanies his departure with crass and rather inaccurate statements like <em>“I represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris,”</em> it allows the intelligentsia to sneer. But it is an ingenious summation. The Paris Accord hurts steel workers in Pittsburgh, so it is out.

To me, this indicates that NATO allies the EU and lots of the world aren’t really observing and analyzing their foe. They aren’t looking at his political base and understanding what he is doing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do most doctors fully understand human physiology? At least to the degree they need to for public health and chronic disease? Most doctors think they know plenty about human physiology, but many don’t. In fact, many doctors are missing some of the most fundamental principles of how human physiology misfires when consuming the modern western diet, particularly too much meat and dairy. What most doctors are taught in medical school is a set of rules created more around pharmacological-based medicine and less about true evidenced-based medicine.

Is there a flaw or a conspiracy? Nobody can claim any one reason to the problem. Nevertheless, many of the rules governing how modern health care is taught and practiced can be linked back some 100 years earlier to the Flexner Report. The Flexner Report came out in the early 1900s and it still accounts for much of how medicine is controlled in the modern era. The report essentially enabled a few powerful global elites to insert themselves and their personal bias and beliefs into how the science and education of modern medicine is conducted and controlled in the United States, and fundamentally throughout the world. It may have done more harm than good, as it has led to a global epidemic of chronically sick human beings. This new generation of humans may be the first in history with a lifespan less than that of their parents.

This article is not about the Flexner Report or modern suppression of the scientific evidence related to the reversal of heart disease with diet and supplementation, which can accelerate the process. That can be explored another day. This blog is about using the evidence-based knowledge and research we currently have, and then applying it correctly to achieve the successful reversal of heart disease and possibly many other leading chronic diseases.
<h1>Reverse Heart Disease: Plant Based Diet, Niacin and HGH Therapy</h1>
Heart Disease Key Facts:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death globally each and every year.
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>It’s estimated that 17.5 million people died from cardiovascular disease in 2012. 7.4 million of these deaths were due to heart disease and 6.7 million caused by stroke.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Most (we would argue all) of these deaths are preventable with diet and lifestyle changes.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The good news is cardiovascular disease can be avoided. The better news is now it can be reversed, even in patients who are in the later stages of coronary artery disease.

One of the first clues we need to look at in our understanding of true human physiology is to explore why dogs don’t die of heart attacks. Is it because they eat only dog food? If you want to test this on your cardiologist, ask him the question below.
<blockquote><strong>The next time you’re sitting across from your cardiologist, ask him: “Dr., why don’t dogs die of heart attacks?” See how they respond!</strong></blockquote>
The answer is an easy one. It shows us a lot about how simple heart disease is to avoid, reverse, and RESOLVE!
<blockquote><strong>Atherosclerosis is easily produced experimentally in herbivores (rabbits) by giving them diets containing large quantities of cholesterol (egg yolks) or saturated fats (animal fats), while impossible to induce in tigers, lions and dogs!</strong></blockquote>
Armed with this information, most third graders can begin to solve the riddle of modern heart disease. Our epidemic of cardiovascular disease is mainly due to the level of animal based products we consume. Therefore, humans must be more physiologically associated to herbivores, so we should eat more similarly to herbivores than to carnivores if we want to protect ourselves from disease. This is profound to understanding how to manage, prevent and reverse cardiovascular disease properly. If we just eat fruits and vegetables, ideally a well planned healthy whole-food plant based diet, these diseases will decline and possibly disappear completely. That’s exactly what doctors Dean Ornish, M.D. and Caldwell Esselstyn, M.D. did in their published research on reversing heart disease.
<h3>Plant-Based Diet: A plant-based diet combined with Niacin and HGH replacement therapy can help reverse heart disease.</h3>
Read Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, MD research

Here are the rules to Dr. Esselstyn’s program in their simplest form taken from his book:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>You may not eat anything with a mother or a face (no meat, poultry, or fish).</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You cannot eat dairy products.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>You must not consume oil of any kind— not a drop. (Yes, you devotees of the Mediterranean Diet, that includes olive oil)</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Generally, you cannot eat nuts or avocados.</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Esselstyn states further, you can eat a wonderful variety of delicious, nutrient-dense foods:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>All vegetables except avocado. Leafy green vegetables, root vegetables, veggies that are red, green, purple, orange, and yellow and everything in between.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All legumes— beans, peas, and lentils of all varieties. All whole grains and products, such as bread and pasta, that are made from them— as long as they do not contain added fats.</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>All fruits.– Esselstyn Jr. M.D., Caldwell B.. Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease</strong></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Basically, if you can navigate these rules, you can work with one of our nutritionists to build a heart healthy diet around these rules. For many, it may seem impossible, but once people learn there are a number of delicious recipes, a transformation in dietary habits can be taught and applied in a matter of a week or two. Dr. Dean Ornish found in his research that it usually required approximately 72 hours of instruction before it really begins to click in the minds of the patient.

To summarize Esselstyn: “Heart disease is nothing more than a paper tiger.” We agree. It is nothing more than working to keep total cholesterol around 150 mg/dL and LDL-c below 60 mg/dL. It’s been reported, that no one ever died of cardiovascular disease in the famous Framingham Heart Study with a total cholesterol of 150 or lower. That was a multi-generational study which began in the late 1940s and continued into the 1990s.

That’s about where the Esselstyn / Ornish style heart reversal programs end. A whole food plant based diet. What we can do in addition is combine other research, and those supplements shown in the research, to help accelerate and improve body composition and lipids (HGH and Niacin primarily), leading to better results sooner. This kind of program can be started at any of our international treatment centers under the supervision of a medical professional and counselors experienced in plant-based nutrition protocols.
<h3><strong>Niacin: Niacin is an important component for reversing heart disease with HGH and Diet
</strong></h3>
First we start with Niacin. Niacin is an inexpensive vitamin supplement. It’s one of the first supplements used to treat low HDL. HDL cholesterol is called the cleaning cholesterol. It’s the good cholesterol that helps remove the bad (LDL) cholesterol. This is a simple explanation, but more or less that’s what is going on inside your arteries. The good HDL helps clear the bad LDL. Treatment works to drive down LDL cholesterol (the oxidized / bad form ) with diet, and elevate the HDL cholesterol (cleaning / good form) with Niacin. Therefore, the anti-atherogenic effects of HDL occur by reverse cholesterol transport of oxidized LDL cholesterol, resulting in restoring part or all of endothelial cell function. (<em>Endothelial cells are the lining in your artery walls</em>).

Niacin has been shown to raise HDL (good cholesterol) by as much as 30-35%. It can also reduce LDL (bad cholesterol) particle size (a good thing) from small dense pattern B to larger non-atherogenic pattern A.

Generally we recommend 1 – 3 grams of Niacin per day (See Ref: Baylor University Medical Proceedings p 126, Vol. 26, No. 2).

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>HGH / IGF-1: HGH is another important component to reversing heart disease with a plant-based diet and niacin.
</strong></h3>
We all know that obesity is strongly correlated to heart disease. Epidemiological studies demonstrate an increase in coronary heart disease mortality in men and women with higher than average body mass indexes. What’s more, obesity is strongly related to cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated blood pressure, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia.

In the famous Dr. Rudman study on HGH in men over 60 years of age, it was found that decreased levels of growth hormone secretion is responsible in part to a decrease in lean body mass, and an increase in fat tissue mass. HGH replacement therapy helps aging men and women maintain more muscle mass and less fat, resulting in an overall improved body composition.

It’s also been shown that diabetic women who use natural bio-identical hormone replacement therapy are more likely to have their blood glucose under control and have lower cholesterol levels.

In recent studies it has been shown that short courses of growth hormone replacement therapy reduced LDL (bad cholesterol). That’s good, as we want bad cholesterol to be below 60 mg/dL ideally.

HGH shows improvements in exercise capacity and cardiac function. Those undergoing HGH replacement therapy show increased oxygen uptake and power output during exercise. Echocardiography has shown that left ventricular muscle mass index, fractional shortening, and fiber shortening velocity all improve after 6 months of low-dose HGH therapy.

Cardiovascular symptoms of growth hormone deficiency include:
<ul>
 	<li>Hardened vessels (sclerosis of vessel wall).</li>
 	<li>Hyperlipidemia</li>
 	<li>Reduced NO-production</li>
 	<li>Increased fibrinogen and PAI-1</li>
 	<li>Hypertension</li>
</ul>
Ref: A4M Michael Klentze, MD, PhD p 418

These factors along with overall body composition attest to the benefits of supporting a heart healthy diet with niacin and HGH replacement therapies. For those with heart disease or for those who wish to live longer without heart disease, we can help. Heart disease can be avoided and reversed with a whole food plant based diet. Outcomes can be improved and accelerated with additional HGH and Niacin supplementation.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Four test playing nations. A former World Number One lost its way to experience one of the lowest points in the annals of their sporting history. In recent times, a supremely insurmountable side at home became more prone to defeats. A team famously regarded as the most volatile side to have taken the field endured isolation and wilderness in the Arabian deserts. A team deemed misfit started making significant strides that the world took note of. These are tumultuous yet exciting times for the test playing nations from the subcontinent.<span id="more-961"></span>

One day, the leaves wither as they turn old. India and Sri Lanka are primarily experiencing this phase. There are more greens on their tree today. Pakistan is almost in a situation where the leaves are about to fall. The cricketing expiry for Misbah and Younus is much closer than what it was yesterday. Take the story of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, for example. The chances of comeback become slim for the veteran sportsmen moment the form slips away. As long as the fire in the lamp withstands the external pressure of the winds, these legendary players can continue writing more pages in their autobiographies.

&nbsp;

India, now in the Sri Lankan shores, are all set to be challenged in conditions they are more familiar of. Ever since the dramatic 8-0 whitewashes in 2011-12, India showed mild signs of recovery. They have had to reshuffle the batting line up ever since the glorious trinity signed off along with the famous Delhi openers who seem to have lost their mojo. Fortunately, they have managed to construct another batting order which a lot of top ranked test countries can feel jealous about. But that’s about the best part of the segment that the team can feel proud of. As a unit, the losses at South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia meant that the slide wasn’t arrested. With the one-off Bangladesh test abandoned due to rain, this Lankan tour is the beginning of a two year journey around the rivers and mountains of the sub-continent.

With a new leader and with the Board all set to soon announce the new coach, who would be the man to plot the route map for the future, India’s test resurgence is in tricky waters. The followers of the sport in the mad nation have had a long break since the IPL. Since IPL they have had to endure an ignominious one-day tour of Bangladesh. It has been the longest break for the team for a long time. Kohli has promised that he will play five bowlers thus thrusting more responsibility both on the top and the lower order batsmen. So far, Kohli’s approach as a leader has been all about making the moves to create a positive result. The aggressive attitude now goes a step further to embolden and empower the players with more trust and responsibility. It is time for his players to contribute with a very conscious mindset craving for consistency. With more matches scheduled in the sub-continent, the onus would be on the spinners to take lead with the attack.

On the other side of the border, Pakistan’s resurgence in test cricket has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is no easy task to defend at the adopted home as well as to beat the Lankans in their territory. Significantly, the batsmen contributed crucial runs for their bowlers to pick twenty wickets. After a relentless search for steady batsmen who build their game on temperament, Pakistan seem to have solved the puzzle. Ahmed Shehzad’s ability to convert starts into hundreds has provided a reasonable stability at the top of the order. Shan Masood, is still very young. But he showed enough gumption to convince about his ability and temperament. Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali have been the biggest finds for Pakistan cricket in recent times. They have been the pillars around whom the game revolves. The best part about the two is that, they emerge from a different school of cricket where calmness and patience are considered as stepping stones for success. Shafiq and Ali have both tasted success and have good knowledge of what it takes to score hundreds in test matches. Between Shafiq and Ali, come the most experienced Pakistani pair of Younus Khan and Misbah Ul Haq. While they both don’t seem to come close to an end with their careers, Pakistan’s fresh approach in ODIs gives a good look into their batting resources when the legends call it a day. That Pakistan completed a rout in Sri Lanka, defeating the hosts in all formats of the game, shows that the team is experiencing a positive growth. After the final T20, there were great scenes of camaraderie and team bonding. Importantly, Pakistan have showed that they enough stomach for challenge and hunger for victory.

The inclusion of Sarfaraz Ahmed in the middle order is the single most powerful addition for their line-up. Teams are prone to produce inconsistent results if they carry a lot of flashy batsmen. Such batsmen will change the complexion of the game within a session or two. Since their approach can’t be tempered, it would be difficult to expect them play a fighting innings. Sarfaraz, amazingly, can play both roles. He has lent fire to the batting order that finally found solidity and method to their game.

While Pakistan need not worry about the fast bowler produce, Saeed Ajmal’s exit from the scene could have spelt dooms for any team. Yasir Shah’s emergence as an attacking leg spinner smoothened the transition. Yasir Shah provides Misbah with both control and strike force. When the batsmen succeed, Shah becomes a bigger prospect for Pakistan’s success. The way he bowled in Sri Lanka on not so friendly surfaces was a display of his stern character and his ability to play according to the conditions.

Pakistan’s biggest challenge, though, is yet to arrive. They have slowly begun to become a strong opponent in home conditions. But just like how the challenge was for India, or for that matter any other subcontinent team, Pakistan’s ability to survive and succeed will be tested on a bigger scale when they play in Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand.

The latest victim of the Bangladesh assault were the South Africans. Not so long ago, Bangladesh gave both India and Pakistan a rude lesson that told the world that they have finally arrived. While Bangladesh’s resurgence has mostly been in the ODIs, they made some impression when they bowled out South Africa for under 250 and took an important lead in the first test at Dhaka. The promise that Bangladesh have shown in the past six months only makes us believe that the team has matured heads who are ready to act responsibly for team’s success now. At the helm of affairs is Hathurusinghe, who is carving a legacy of his own with this resurgence. The coach has gone the long yards to make his team believe that they definitely can. The likes of Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mashrafe Mortaza have absorbed enough quality of international cricket, that they can be the torch bearers for Bangladesh cricket now. These players have shown immense maturity in taking ownership on the field and guiding the younger ones in the best way possible.

Considering the following that Bangladesh have in their backyard, it was going to be impossible for them to never improve. All this while, the stars who are torch bearers today were seeking inspiration to grow bigger. Their heroes never made it big. They got back home defeated again and again.

With Australia touring Bangladesh next, there wouldn’t be a better measure of their progress than testing it against Australia’s Gold Standard.

Sri Lanka have a problem aplenty. It is a mixed scenario that each of India and Pakistan have experienced for a long time. Under Angelo Mathews, this Lankan team is taking baby steps with their resurgence. The best aspect of this resurgence has been the performance of their fast bowlers. The tank is full with quality that Mathews can afford to prepare fast and seaming tracks for their bowlers to achieve desired results. Dhammika Prasad has come of age. Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal and Dushmantha Chameera have had their moments. Twenty three year old Chameera, especially, has come for a lot of praise. Along with the captain himself, Sri Lanka’s pace attack are in good shape for the present and for the immediate future.

But their real concerns come with their batsmen. Jayawardane is gone. Dilshan is gone. So will Sangakkara by the end of this month. While the batting has shown odd sparks with Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews continues to be the lynch pin in this batting order. The replacements and the next-in-line are the players who have been there with the team earlier. Jehan Mubarak’s and Upul Tharanga’s selections gives away the fact that the older men who were discarded before, continue to be the best of the lot to play test cricket. Sangakkara’s fear in the loss of quality in the first class cricket, is well placed. If the structure can’t produce new talents then there is something wrong that needs to be fixed at the earliest.

The Lankans trust Chandimal and Thirimanne a lot. While they have been impressive in shorter formats, both players need to raise their hands up now to shoulder responsibility. The series against India, is hence going to be very crucial for these two players. If both of them fail to make any mark, the middle order will be in tatters.]]></content:encoded>

These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

It’s kind of confusing because I’m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says.

They released me in this campaign with everyone else there no distinction. It’s not a separate section for plus size girls she says.

There was a time in the industry not too long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was using plus size models as a headline-grabbing gimmick see the groundbreaking <a href="#">Italian Vogue</a> cover featuring Tara Lynn, Candice Huffine, and Robyn Lawley in June 2016.long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was.

These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Four test playing nations. A former World Number One lost its way to experience one of the lowest points in the annals of their sporting history. In recent times, a supremely insurmountable side at home became more prone to defeats. A team famously regarded as the most volatile side to have taken the field endured isolation and wilderness in the Arabian deserts. A team deemed misfit started making significant strides that the world took note of. These are tumultuous yet exciting times for the test playing nations from the subcontinent.

One day, the leaves wither as they turn old. India and Sri Lanka are primarily experiencing this phase. There are more greens on their tree today. Pakistan is almost in a situation where the leaves are about to fall. The cricketing expiry for Misbah and Younus is much closer than what it was yesterday. Take the story of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, for example. The chances of comeback become slim for the veteran sportsmen moment the form slips away. As long as the fire in the lamp withstands the external pressure of the winds, these legendary players can continue writing more pages in their autobiographies.

&nbsp;

India, now in the Sri Lankan shores, are all set to be challenged in conditions they are more familiar of. Ever since the dramatic 8-0 whitewashes in 2011-12, India showed mild signs of recovery. They have had to reshuffle the batting line up ever since the glorious trinity signed off along with the famous Delhi openers who seem to have lost their mojo. Fortunately, they have managed to construct another batting order which a lot of top ranked test countries can feel jealous about. But that’s about the best part of the segment that the team can feel proud of. As a unit, the losses at South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia meant that the slide wasn’t arrested. With the one-off Bangladesh test abandoned due to rain, this Lankan tour is the beginning of a two year journey around the rivers and mountains of the sub-continent.

With a new leader and with the Board all set to soon announce the new coach, who would be the man to plot the route map for the future, India’s test resurgence is in tricky waters. The followers of the sport in the mad nation have had a long break since the IPL. Since IPL they have had to endure an ignominious one-day tour of Bangladesh. It has been the longest break for the team for a long time. Kohli has promised that he will play five bowlers thus thrusting more responsibility both on the top and the lower order batsmen. So far, Kohli’s approach as a leader has been all about making the moves to create a positive result. The aggressive attitude now goes a step further to embolden and empower the players with more trust and responsibility. It is time for his players to contribute with a very conscious mindset craving for consistency. With more matches scheduled in the sub-continent, the onus would be on the spinners to take lead with the attack.

On the other side of the border, Pakistan’s resurgence in test cricket has been nothing less than extraordinary. It is no easy task to defend at the adopted home as well as to beat the Lankans in their territory. Significantly, the batsmen contributed crucial runs for their bowlers to pick twenty wickets. After a relentless search for steady batsmen who build their game on temperament, Pakistan seem to have solved the puzzle. Ahmed Shehzad’s ability to convert starts into hundreds has provided a reasonable stability at the top of the order. Shan Masood, is still very young. But he showed enough gumption to convince about his ability and temperament. Asad Shafiq and Azhar Ali have been the biggest finds for Pakistan cricket in recent times. They have been the pillars around whom the game revolves. The best part about the two is that, they emerge from a different school of cricket where calmness and patience are considered as stepping stones for success. Shafiq and Ali have both tasted success and have good knowledge of what it takes to score hundreds in test matches. Between Shafiq and Ali, come the most experienced Pakistani pair of Younus Khan and Misbah Ul Haq. While they both don’t seem to come close to an end with their careers, Pakistan’s fresh approach in ODIs gives a good look into their batting resources when the legends call it a day. That Pakistan completed a rout in Sri Lanka, defeating the hosts in all formats of the game, shows that the team is experiencing a positive growth. After the final T20, there were great scenes of camaraderie and team bonding. Importantly, Pakistan have showed that they enough stomach for challenge and hunger for victory.

The inclusion of Sarfaraz Ahmed in the middle order is the single most powerful addition for their line-up. Teams are prone to produce inconsistent results if they carry a lot of flashy batsmen. Such batsmen will change the complexion of the game within a session or two. Since their approach can’t be tempered, it would be difficult to expect them play a fighting innings. Sarfaraz, amazingly, can play both roles. He has lent fire to the batting order that finally found solidity and method to their game.

While Pakistan need not worry about the fast bowler produce, Saeed Ajmal’s exit from the scene could have spelt dooms for any team. Yasir Shah’s emergence as an attacking leg spinner smoothened the transition. Yasir Shah provides Misbah with both control and strike force. When the batsmen succeed, Shah becomes a bigger prospect for Pakistan’s success. The way he bowled in Sri Lanka on not so friendly surfaces was a display of his stern character and his ability to play according to the conditions.

Pakistan’s biggest challenge, though, is yet to arrive. They have slowly begun to become a strong opponent in home conditions. But just like how the challenge was for India, or for that matter any other subcontinent team, Pakistan’s ability to survive and succeed will be tested on a bigger scale when they play in Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand.

The latest victim of the Bangladesh assault were the South Africans. Not so long ago, Bangladesh gave both India and Pakistan a rude lesson that told the world that they have finally arrived. While Bangladesh’s resurgence has mostly been in the ODIs, they made some impression when they bowled out South Africa for under 250 and took an important lead in the first test at Dhaka. The promise that Bangladesh have shown in the past six months only makes us believe that the team has matured heads who are ready to act responsibly for team’s success now. At the helm of affairs is Hathurusinghe, who is carving a legacy of his own with this resurgence. The coach has gone the long yards to make his team believe that they definitely can. The likes of Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mashrafe Mortaza have absorbed enough quality of international cricket, that they can be the torch bearers for Bangladesh cricket now. These players have shown immense maturity in taking ownership on the field and guiding the younger ones in the best way possible.

Considering the following that Bangladesh have in their backyard, it was going to be impossible for them to never improve. All this while, the stars who are torch bearers today were seeking inspiration to grow bigger. Their heroes never made it big. They got back home defeated again and again.

With Australia touring Bangladesh next, there wouldn’t be a better measure of their progress than testing it against Australia’s Gold Standard.

Sri Lanka have a problem aplenty. It is a mixed scenario that each of India and Pakistan have experienced for a long time. Under Angelo Mathews, this Lankan team is taking baby steps with their resurgence. The best aspect of this resurgence has been the performance of their fast bowlers. The tank is full with quality that Mathews can afford to prepare fast and seaming tracks for their bowlers to achieve desired results. Dhammika Prasad has come of age. Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal and Dushmantha Chameera have had their moments. Twenty three year old Chameera, especially, has come for a lot of praise. Along with the captain himself, Sri Lanka’s pace attack are in good shape for the present and for the immediate future.

But their real concerns come with their batsmen. Jayawardane is gone. Dilshan is gone. So will Sangakkara by the end of this month. While the batting has shown odd sparks with Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews continues to be the lynch pin in this batting order. The replacements and the next-in-line are the players who have been there with the team earlier. Jehan Mubarak’s and Upul Tharanga’s selections gives away the fact that the older men who were discarded before, continue to be the best of the lot to play test cricket. Sangakkara’s fear in the loss of quality in the first class cricket, is well placed. If the structure can’t produce new talents then there is something wrong that needs to be fixed at the earliest.

The Lankans trust Chandimal and Thirimanne a lot. While they have been impressive in shorter formats, both players need to raise their hands up now to shoulder responsibility. The series against India, is hence going to be very crucial for these two players. If both of them fail to make any mark, the middle order will be in tatters.

<em><strong>«There’s something happening here; What it is ain’t exactly clear.» </strong>-For What It’s Worth, Buffalo Springfield 1967</em>

This lyric, written 50 years ago about another time could apply to our world now. What we understood about the sixties revolution after it happened was that it was a reaction to a deep unhappiness with the established order that had brought two world wars. People didn’t know what exactly they wanted, but they certainly didn’t want what they had come to see as normal.

Now, five months into Donald Trump’s America, as we watch Brexit threaten the foundations of the European Union and stand appalled at increasingly nihilistic Islamist terrorism it is clear something is happening. The old order is crumbling. That’s easy to interpret. The difficult part is who is opposing who? It is a fast emerging conflict, but broadly it is between opportunist, populist, revanchist and nationalistic politicians and their followers against the ancient regime of liberal, consensus leaning, globalist internationalists.

President Trump is the standard bearer for the first group, but he has fellow travelers in Britain and across Europe. This, let us call it a movement, is not slavishly committed to political correctness or multiculturalism. Russia is being connected to Trump by the Western media. But a lot of this is down to the fact that Vladimir Putin, too, refuses to kow tow to the second group.

For the last 30 years liberal, consensus driven, globalist politics dominated the rich, influential power blocs. The United States and the European Union (EU) through the 1980s and 1990s dominated world politics. And the two power blocs, intertwined with the military alliance of NATO and supported by the United Nations formed one all dominating, usually cohesive conglomerate.

The EU, though it expanded to 27 countries, and was supposed to represent a homogenous group was and is dominated by an axis of Germany and France. The EU will not deviate toward policy that adversely affects the interests of this axis.

The United Kingdom stood up to the French-German axis, and now it has left. Russia, re-emerging with confidence, would not be intimidated. But all this the EU and its dominating powers could handle. Then Trump became US President. This wild card has blown all the old certainties away.

Rapidly the accepted pillars of global politics have crumbled. The old way of doing things, driven by the liberal democracies and leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel was stuttering. A week ago, in a Bavarian Beer Hall, Angela Merkel was driven to say: <em>“The times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent over.”</em>

Merkel supporters – and even her internal enemies – nodded at her bellicose language.

She was saying that Trump’s America, the ‘want away’ British and the cynical Russians and everybody else can’t be relied on anymore. They disagree, and they must be wrong. There is a general acceptance in the global, opinion setting liberal media that these three power blocs have wronged the EU power brokers.

This scolding from Merkel was inspired by Trump’s tour through Europe when he did some scolding of his own.

At a G7 meeting in Sicily Trump criticized America’s traditional European allies over NATO obligations and made clear that he was willing to go it alone on climate change and trade.

The Old Guard, led by Germany its close EU colleagues, are characterizing Trump, the British and other nations and political movements who oppose them as right wing and reactionary. The language of their criticism carries innuendo. Those who oppose them are violent, racist and backward thinking. The narrative from the European leaders in the EU to the departing British has been that they are a nation of fools led by inward looking politicians.

America too is, they say, a misguided country led by a backward, isolationist leader in Donald Trump. These views are strongly supported by large swathes of the media. The Western media is predominantly liberal, leftist and supportive of consensus politics.

I contend that it is the consensus, liberal politicians that are out of step. It is they who are suddenly seen to be tied to an out-of-date and exhausted ideology. The reaction of the European democracies to Trump indicates history has overtaken them.

Trump said at a NATO meeting in Brussels at the end of May <em>“NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations.”</em>

And it was met with shock.

Trump has been castigating NATO and the unwillingness of America’s partners to spend the required 2 percent of GDP on defense for well over a year now. He has driven it home time after time.

I was in Washington when he told Merkel to her face about his concerns.

When Trump last week pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord there was a worldwide shrill revulsion.

Belatedly some thinkers and writers have come to see that the reaction to this was over the top. Again, amazingly, many world leaders and commentators have not been listening to what Trump has been saying. Or why he is saying it.

He has opposed this deal since he rose to become a Presidential contender a year ago.

His castigation of NATO is not some mindless attack on old allies. It is a deep belief that America is being taken advantage of. America First he says and he means it.

His exit from the Paris deal is down to the fact that he believes it is a bad deal for America. And many agree with him.

And we get to back to basic politics. Trump was elected in the Rust Belt of the United States. And Greater Appalachia, a huge neglected, mainly white area in the middle of the United States that has been wonderfully chronicled in the Hillbilly Elegy memoir of JD Vance.

Trump believes the Paris Accord is unfair. It is bad for the US, it is bad for the US coal industry, and it is bad for the working class folk in the middle America states that elected him. And he is out.

When he accompanies his departure with crass and rather inaccurate statements like <em>“I represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris,”</em> it allows the intelligentsia to sneer. But it is an ingenious summation. The Paris Accord hurts steel workers in Pittsburgh, so it is out.

To me, this indicates that NATO allies the EU and lots of the world aren’t really observing and analyzing their foe. They aren’t looking at his political base and understanding what he is doing.]]></content:encoded>

These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

It’s kind of confusing because I’m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says.

They released me in this campaign with everyone else there no distinction. It’s not a separate section for plus size girls she says.

There was a time in the industry not too long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was using plus size models as a headline-grabbing gimmick see the groundbreaking <a href="#">Italian Vogue</a> cover featuring Tara Lynn, Candice Huffine, and Robyn Lawley in June 2016.long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was.

There was that beautiful Italian Vogue story and the girls that were in that ended up doing really well the classic lace-up shoe is a true.

I feel like for a minute, it was starting to feel like this plus size I’m not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls really was a trend.

That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.
<h5><strong>WordPress a difficult game because everyone wants to be cool in fashion.</strong></h5>
Now, Dalbesio is a bit more hopeful about size in the modeling industry ma quande lingues coalesce. In the middle Occidental in fact she says not skinny enough.That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.

But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant right to find fault pleasure?

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee,take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

It’s kind of confusing because I’m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says. I’m not the biggest girl on the market but I’m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn’t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.It’s kind of confusing because I’m a bigger girl, Dalbesio says.

Refreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.

<blockquote>BE THE CHANGE THAT YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD</blockquote>
They released me in this campaign with everyone else there no distinction. It’s not a separate section for plus size girls she says.

There was a time in the industry not too long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was using plus size models as a headline-grabbing gimmick see the groundbreaking <a href="#">Italian Vogue</a> cover featuring Tara Lynn, Candice Huffine, and Robyn Lawley in June 2016.long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was.

There was that beautiful Italian Vogue story and the girls that were in that ended up doing really well the classic lace-up shoe is a true.

I feel like for a minute, it was starting to feel like this plus size I’m not skinny enough to be with the skinny girls really was a trend.

That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.
<h5><strong>WordPress a difficult game because everyone wants to be cool in fashion.</strong></h5>
Now, Dalbesio is a bit more hopeful about size in the modeling industry ma quande lingues coalesce. In the middle Occidental in fact she says not skinny enough.That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.

To find my place. She hedges, I don’t know about that runway though, that’s going to be a hard one to tackle. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant right to find fault pleasure?

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee,take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This lyric, written 50 years ago about another time could apply to our world now. What we understood about the sixties revolution after it happened was that it was a reaction to a deep unhappiness with the established order that had brought two world wars. People didn’t know what exactly they wanted, but they certainly didn’t want what they had come to see as normal.

Now, five months into Donald Trump’s America, as we watch Brexit threaten the foundations of the European Union and stand appalled at increasingly nihilistic Islamist terrorism it is clear something is happening. The old order is crumbling. That’s easy to interpret. The difficult part is who is opposing who? It is a fast emerging conflict, but broadly it is between opportunist, populist, revanchist and nationalistic politicians and their followers against the ancient regime of liberal, consensus leaning, globalist internationalists.

President Trump is the standard bearer for the first group, but he has fellow travelers in Britain and across Europe. This, let us call it a movement, is not slavishly committed to political correctness or multiculturalism. Russia is being connected to Trump by the Western media. But a lot of this is down to the fact that Vladimir Putin, too, refuses to kow tow to the second group.

For the last 30 years liberal, consensus driven, globalist politics dominated the rich, influential power blocs. The United States and the European Union (EU) through the 1980s and 1990s dominated world politics. And the two power blocs, intertwined with the military alliance of NATO and supported by the United Nations formed one all dominating, usually cohesive conglomerate.

The EU, though it expanded to 27 countries, and was supposed to represent a homogenous group was and is dominated by an axis of Germany and France. The EU will not deviate toward policy that adversely affects the interests of this axis.

The United Kingdom stood up to the French-German axis, and now it has left. Russia, re-emerging with confidence, would not be intimidated. But all this the EU and its dominating powers could handle. Then Trump became US President. This wild card has blown all the old certainties away.

Rapidly the accepted pillars of global politics have crumbled. The old way of doing things, driven by the liberal democracies and leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel was stuttering. A week ago, in a Bavarian Beer Hall, Angela Merkel was driven to say: <em>“The times when we could completely rely on others are, to an extent over.”</em>

Merkel supporters – and even her internal enemies – nodded at her bellicose language.

She was saying that Trump’s America, the ‘want away’ British and the cynical Russians and everybody else can’t be relied on anymore. They disagree, and they must be wrong. There is a general acceptance in the global, opinion setting liberal media that these three power blocs have wronged the EU power brokers.

This scolding from Merkel was inspired by Trump’s tour through Europe when he did some scolding of his own.

At a G7 meeting in Sicily Trump criticized America’s traditional European allies over NATO obligations and made clear that he was willing to go it alone on climate change and trade.

The Old Guard, led by Germany its close EU colleagues, are characterizing Trump, the British and other nations and political movements who oppose them as right wing and reactionary. The language of their criticism carries innuendo. Those who oppose them are violent, racist and backward thinking. The narrative from the European leaders in the EU to the departing British has been that they are a nation of fools led by inward looking politicians.

America too is, they say, a misguided country led by a backward, isolationist leader in Donald Trump. These views are strongly supported by large swathes of the media. The Western media is predominantly liberal, leftist and supportive of consensus politics.

I contend that it is the consensus, liberal politicians that are out of step. It is they who are suddenly seen to be tied to an out-of-date and exhausted ideology. The reaction of the European democracies to Trump indicates history has overtaken them.

Trump said at a NATO meeting in Brussels at the end of May <em>“NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations.”</em>

And it was met with shock.

Trump has been castigating NATO and the unwillingness of America’s partners to spend the required 2 percent of GDP on defense for well over a year now. He has driven it home time after time.

I was in Washington when he told Merkel to her face about his concerns.

When Trump last week pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord there was a worldwide shrill revulsion.

Belatedly some thinkers and writers have come to see that the reaction to this was over the top. Again, amazingly, many world leaders and commentators have not been listening to what Trump has been saying. Or why he is saying it.

He has opposed this deal since he rose to become a Presidential contender a year ago.

His castigation of NATO is not some mindless attack on old allies. It is a deep belief that America is being taken advantage of. America First he says and he means it.

His exit from the Paris deal is down to the fact that he believes it is a bad deal for America. And many agree with him.

And we get to back to basic politics. Trump was elected in the Rust Belt of the United States. And Greater Appalachia, a huge neglected, mainly white area in the middle of the United States that has been wonderfully chronicled in the Hillbilly Elegy memoir of JD Vance.

Trump believes the Paris Accord is unfair. It is bad for the US, it is bad for the US coal industry, and it is bad for the working class folk in the middle America states that elected him. And he is out.

When he accompanies his departure with crass and rather inaccurate statements like <em>“I represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris,”</em> it allows the intelligentsia to sneer. But it is an ingenious summation. The Paris Accord hurts steel workers in Pittsburgh, so it is out.

To me, this indicates that NATO allies the EU and lots of the world aren’t really observing and analyzing their foe. They aren’t looking at his political base and understanding what he is doing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

It took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender.

Congratulations, you played yourself. Stay focused. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. Cloth talk.

The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. We the best. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender.They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh.

Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Another one. It’s important to use cocoa pantograph. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold.]]></content:encoded>

These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</p>
</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

[caption id="attachment_1066" align="alignright" width="275"]<img class="wp-image-1066 size-full" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-4.png" alt="single-images-7" width="275" height="376" /> Katy playing audio lessons[/caption]

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

It’s important to use cocoa pantograph. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.
<h4><strong>Don’t wait. The time will never be just right!</strong></h4>
You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Surround yourself with angels. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life.

They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh.

Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast.
<blockquote>Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment! - Oprah Winfrey</blockquote>
Give thanks to the most high. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. Another one.

Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast.

It took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender.

Congratulations, you played yourself. Stay focused. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat. Cloth talk.

The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. We the best. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender.They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh.

Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Another one. It’s important to use cocoa pantograph. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[what’s possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days to the achievement of one goal, how ambitious could you make this goal? These were the questions that the multilingual friends Katy and Sara posed themselves when they determined to learn English, to prove that it can be done and anyone can do it with the right methods,learn English in one week.possible in a week? If you dedicated seven days.

They would attempt to liberate themselves from the distractions and responsibilities of modern-day life in order to cram eight hours of study time and I was observing some of the world’s most capable language learners at work.

[caption id="attachment_137" align="alignnone" width="900"]<img class="size-full wp-image-137" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/russia.jpg" alt="single-images-4" width="900" height="500" /> The language learning expert: Sara[/caption]

The friends set themselves the challenge of learning a language in a week in order to stretch themselves, and then it was a question of choosing which language to learn. English presented itself as a natural option; there are nigh on 300,000 English speakers in Germany’s capital, and the areas are dotted with stores adorned with signs in English,speakers in Germany’s capital.
<blockquote>TRULY UNDERSTANDING ONE’S ENVIRONMENT REQUIRES ONE TO FIRST UNDERSTAND ENGLISH</blockquote>
The first operational step in the friends learning process was to decorate the entire apartment with sticky notes. This had an almost ceremonial touch to it as the friends delved into dictionaries and proceeded to label everything with its corresponding English name, delved into dictionaries .

Within the space of about an hour it was impossible to carry out any menial task, be it making a coffee or flicking off a light switch, without first being presented with at least three different words related to this action,of about an hour it was impossible to carry.

[caption id="attachment_1065" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1065" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-2.png" alt="single-images-6" width="780" height="430" /> Sara learning in the park[/caption]

The importance of the other twin’s presence became immediately apparent as Katy and Sara delegated responsibilities for rooms to decorate with sticky notes. This simple task was augmented by continuous little tests that they would spring on one another, and the fact that they split up their day slightly differently and studied different topics meant that each twin became a source of knowledge for the other.
<blockquote>The most extraordinary moment came towards the end of the week!</blockquote>
The friends simply switched their everyday conversations to English, asking one another if they wanted tea or coffee, were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house.Katy and Sara had numerous micro-challenges throughout the week.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market (although they refrained from purchasing nine hundred thousand kumquats). Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.

On our second visit to the brother’s apartment 24 hours into the week, we found them sampling dozens of different kinds of English snacks.

Like kids staring at the backs of cereal packs before heading to school, the nutritional information and various special offers and competitions on the packaging were analysed during snack breaks,and various special offers.

There was no moment of complete removal from the language learning process during the eight hours that the friends had allotted to it.

They were constantly using their existing knowledge to support the ever-growing knowledge of English, this being the root of their success.

They then learned the names of fruits and the numbers from one to a billion so that they could visit the English market. Displaying their haul after their first functional exchange in English, they beamed with pride and a palpable sense of accomplishment before marching back home to study further.
<blockquote>YOU WILL LIKELY COME ACROSS WORDS THAT SHARE COMMON ORIGINS WITH YOUR NATIVE TONGUE</blockquote>
The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to be found searching busily for English radio stations and write-ups of English football games on the web.

All too often, people enter their weekly language class to converse with their teacher, but then barely have any contact with other speakers and that’s not enough.The old saying that we can solve problems more effectively when we sleep on it may be especially true if the problem we’re trying.

To solve is learning a new language.The friends spent a lot of time engrossed in books or on their computers and apps, flicking and swiping their way through exercises eagerly, but at other times they were to

Researchers from two Swiss universities wanted to know if they could enhance the learning of words from a foreign language by exposing people to the words during non-rapid eye movement sleep the deep, dreamless sleep period that most of us experience during the first few hours of the night.The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am.

To find out, they gathered two groups of study participants, all of whom were native German speakers, and gave them a series of Dutch-to-German word pairs to learn at 10 pm. One group was then instructed to get some sleep, while the other group was kept awake.For the next few hours both groups listened to an audio playback of the word pairs they’d already been exposed to and some they hadn’t yet heard.

The researchers then re-gathered both groups at 2 am and gave them a test of the Dutch words to uncover any differences in learning. And indeed there was a difference:
<blockquote>THE GROUP THAT LISTENED TO THE WORDS DURING SLEEP DID BETTER AT RECALLING THE WORDS THEY’D HEARD</blockquote>
The simple yet potent trick the researchers employed is known as verbal cueing, and this isn’t the first claim made for its success while sleeping. But what makes this study different is that it puts a finer point on the conditions necessary for this trick to actually work namely, it only works when we’ve already been exposed to the verbal cues before we sleep.

[caption id="attachment_1069" align="alignnone" width="780"]<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" src="http://fluentthemes.com/wp/letter/pantograph-variation-two/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/Untitled-6.png" alt="single-images-8" width="780" height="430" /> Internet is always helpful[/caption]

The researchers added a techie dimension by conducting electroencephalographic (EEG)recordings of the sleeping participants brains to track neural electrical activity during the learning period.They found that learning the foreign words overlapped.

They found that learning the foreign words overlapped with the appearance of theta brain waves, an intriguing result since theta is the brainwave state often associated with heightened learning while awake (usually we’re in either the high-frequency, high-alertness alpha or beta states while awake, but it’s thought possible to induce theta state slower in frequency than alpha and beta through concentration techniques.]]></content:encoded>

They released me in this campaign with everyone else there no distinction. It’s not a separate section for plus size girls she says.

There was a time in the industry not too long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was using plus size models as a headline-grabbing gimmick see the groundbreaking <a href="#">Italian Vogue</a> cover featuring Tara Lynn, Candice Huffine, and Robyn Lawley in June 2016.long ago, when it seemed that the high fashion world was.

Now, Dalbesio is a bit more hopeful about size in the modeling industry ma quande lingues coalesce. In the middle Occidental in fact she says not skinny enough.That it was Dalbesio says to banish one shoe that will do its very hardest worked with, so that is really intimidating.

To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant right to find fault pleasure?

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee,take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes.]]></content:encoded>

Great things in business are never done by one person. Theyre done by a team of people.

— Steve JobsCo-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Apple Inc.
The Republican nominee began the debate on the Hofstra University campus in Hempstead, N.Y., as disciplined a debater as he has been, delivering on-message lines about being a candidate who can change Washington. But during the course of almost two hours, the billionaire’s self-control faltered. “Wrong. Wrong. Wrong,” he sputtered into the microphone as his hands firmly gripped the lectern.

Learning to acknowledge and express our emotions freely may seem like weakness in a culture that requires us to be tough, but in actual fact it takes a strength far more valuable and honorable than living in denial.

Use the “Spaced Repetition” technique
Try the “Pinch Yourself” hack
Schedule learning sessions before bedtime
Study the content, not the language
This technique was introduced by Maneesh Sethi, a frequent traveler who mastered four foreign languages as an adult. His approach was based on the fact that negative stimuli massively boost self-improvement.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row top_padding="30px"][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]What is expected six weeks before Election Day?

Get a set of flashcards for memorizing vocabulary or grammar.
Master the hard pinch (it should be quite hard) to activate your body’s threat response.
Review a category of flash cards (such as adjectives or group of words). Don’t pinch yourself at this stage.
Review the same category, now adding the pinch for each vocabulary word. Spend some time studying the card before moving to the next one.
Softening your perspective towards yourself and others; allowing yourself to experience tenderness and nurturing instead may seem counterproductive, but in the long run, may reap more abundant rewards. What remained unclear is whether either candidate had changed voters’ minds or given them permission to firmly link up with a candidate they already leaned toward.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_single_image image="643" img_size="full" add_caption="yes" alignment="right"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Only Clinton’s should feel comfortable as they crawl under the covers.
